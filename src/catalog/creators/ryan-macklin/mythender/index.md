# What is Mythender?

## About this Game

<span class="mythender">Mythender</span> is high-action adventure game where you play amazing, Mythic heroes— called Mythenders—who travel the Mythic World to destroy its gods and monsters. Because, hey, why not? It’s all about leaping off of mountains with your massive, flaming sword drawn and splitting open a giant’s face.

At least, it was a face before you showed up to fix that.

Most of will you take on the role of a <span class="keyword">Mythender</span>: a man, woman, or child turned into a force of destruction. One of you will play the <span class="keyword">Mythmaster</span>, taking on the role of the Mythic World and everyone in it: gods and monsters, powerless mortals, and even the land itself.

You’ll tell the stories of slaughtering gods in a way that goes beyond just killing them— you unmake them, turning them from beings that rule mortals into legends people vaguely remember. This is an Ending, and only you Mythenders have the power to do it.

You’ll tell the stories of interacting with mortals that barely understand you, seeing you just as they see gods and monsters: terrible beings that have far more power than they can imagine. You can break Thor’s jaw, but getting a little girl to smile instead of running from your glorious and horrific visage? That doesn’t come easy to those who wield Mythic power.

You’ll tell the stories of struggling against becoming gods yourselves.You live in the vicious cycle of apotheosis and deicide, as you must take on the corrupting powers of the Mythic World in order to End its gods. Each time you take more of that much-needed power, you take a step away from your mortal soul and a step closer to becoming a Myth.

Or you’ll tell the stories of how you ignore all that humanity business and go pedal to the fucking metal, diving headfirst into the heart of Myth and leaving piles of corpses in your wake. You’ll gain power by making mortals to worship you as a god. Eventually, your comrades will be forced to murder your Mythic ass.

Spoiler alert: _they totally fucking will_.

### Inspirations

This game takes inspiration from fantastical movies like _300_, _Beowulf_, _Final Fantasy VII: Advent Children_, _The Two Towers_, and _Return of the King_. It takes inspiration from fantastical anime where the Mythic and mortal worlds and intertwined. And it takes inspiration from the Greek tales of mortals raging against monsters, titans, and gods (especially the _God of War_ video game series). Anything where people with strange powers battle against gigantic, Mythical foes can be a <span class="mythender">Mythender</span> story.

<span class="mythender">Mythender</span> is about kicking ass and erasing names to a heavy metal sound track, about dancing on the knife’s edge between having the power to slaughter abominations and becoming an abomination yourself. Go do that already.

### An Assumption

<span class="mythender">Mythender</span> assumes that at least one person in the group is familiar with the basic dynamics of playing a roleplaying game around a table—the Mythmaster (what some roleplaying games call a “Game Master”). If you’re looking for an introduction to this genre of gaming, I recommend the excellent _Fate Accelerated_, which can be found at [FateRPG.com](http://www.faterpg.com).

## Metal & Drama

In many travelogue-style roleplaying games, the main characters go around to strange places, probably killing things and maybe righting what they see as wrongs. <span class="mythender">Mythender</span> is no different, except that the characters are immensely powerful loci of change and destruction who risk becoming soon-to-be-axed-in-the-face gods if they aren’t careful about the power they command.

There are two main ways that the game is played: as a heavy metal-blasting movie that would make Michael Bay and Zack Snyder blush, or as a deep drama about the personal struggle between needing power and the corruption it brings.

### Mythender as Metal

If what you want is a game where you play out one crazy, deicide-rific battle after the next, great! Get over the top with describing how things explode all around you as you walk calmly to gut Fenrir. If you love the fighty anime, this game works for those moments where two foes are flying through the air exchanging sword blows, or for foes at a distance throwing magic and raw power at each other.

You’ll be spending most of your time playing in battles, and not much in between; just enough to get you to the next battle.

### Mythender as Drama

If what you want is a game where you’re emo about the choice between mortality and apotheosis, about what it means to be human and have a mortal soul, and the struggle between having the power to fix anything wrong with the world and the price of that power, then <span class="mythender">Mythender</span>’s for you!

You’ll be spending quite a bit of time playing outside of battles, interacting with the mortals of a place and struggling to get them to believe you’re a human being. There will be moments where you’ll battle, as the world still deserves your wrath.

### Mixing Metal & Drama

Many people want both! <span class="mythender">Mythender</span> is best when you’re playing metal during a battle and getting your drama on afterward. Jumping a hundred feet in the air and causing an earthquake when you land during a battle is awesome! And dealing with the farmer whose land you just destroyed in that battle makes for great personal struggle and drama.

### Playing This Game Wrong

The way to play this game wrong is to play a metal game when you want some time to explore your humanity (or lack thereof), or play emo when you want to burst into flames and sunder the heavens. Whether it’s one player being too silly (or not silly enough), or the Mythmaster framing the game in a different direction than the rest of the group wants, speak up! It’s your game, so have the fun you’re looking for.

## The Mythic Worlds

The world you and I live in is not the first world. This world of ours is the mortal world, almost entirely free of monsters and gods that force themselves on our lives and demand worship. Ours was the world forged by Mythenders destroying all that is Mythic.

### The Time Before Ours

Before this mortal world, there were many Mythic Worlds—lands where gods and monsters were real and ruled over the mortals. These beings of Myth could change the land, the weather, everything around them…if enough mortals paid them in fear and respect.

Each Mythic World is a frightful land of extremes, with weather made hostile to those who do not pay respect, with creatures that prey on weak and weary mortals, with gods that create and destroy at whim.

These gods and monsters are known by the name “Myths,” a word that today means “some made-up crap that ancient people used to explain stuff they didn’t understand.” That isn’t what the word always meant, for they were not always just stories, and those ancient people understood very well how their world worked. It once meant “inhuman master” and “he who holds my fate.”

### The World is Alive

As powerful as the gods are, there is one thing more powerful: the land itself. Each Mythic World is alive, though not in any way that you or I could understand. It does not speak with words, but through the rumblings of earth and sky, and through its divine mouthpieces. The World is a bitch mother to its inhuman children, a wolf ready to rip the throats out of those who would threaten them. And just like any family, her children may fight amongst each other, but when someone from outside gets involved, they band together with the full power of their mother-world behind them.

### Enter the Mythenders

Before written history, the Mythic Worlds fought each other for power—for ownership of mortal lives. Then the unexpected happened: mortals claimed Mythic power for themselves and warred against the Mythic Worlds.

That mortals have taken Mythic power was not new. The gods would grant those followers worthy power, as sorcerers who could command the elements, to giving a tribe the power to change into great beasts, and even granting apotheosis to those rare, special mortals that the Mythic World deemed bold enough to stand as gods. But these new mortals were different. They did not ask for power. _They took it_.

What was most unexpected: they did not seek to destroy gods in order to supplant them. That would be fine to the Mythic World, for that has happened before. No, they sought destruction for other goals: some for its own sake, some to make mortals free of Mythic oppression, some for revenge against the gods, and some merely because it suits their whim.

And they won. Many smaller, weaker Mythic Worlds died at the hands of these…Enders of Myth. They created the first of the mortal lands, where no god could touch them. They created strange magics that kept monsters from invading, things we today call “history” and “time.”

Mythenders handed the Mythic Worlds their collective asses, ripped in twain.

### Mythic Norden

The greatest Worlds saw this onslaught and experienced a sensation they never before had: terror. But one World saw hope, for these Mythenders had one fatal flaw—to challenge the gods, they needed to steal power from the Mythic. This was the World of Norden—land of Odin, Thor, and Loki. This was a land of ice and peril, of grand warrior-cults, both living and dead.

It had a plan and shared it with the other Mythic Worlds: they would taint that power, mixing with it corruption. If these Mythenders would not willingly becomes gods, they would do so unwillingly.

And Norden continued to live while other Worlds died. Odin has been slaughtered countless times, but always with a fallen Mythender to replace him.

Mythic Norden is the default setting in <span class="mythender">Mythender</span>. You can find more details in the **Mythic Norden** chapter.

### Other Mythic Worlds

There are many other Mythic Worlds not detailed in this book, including:

**Mythic Atlantis,** where those cut off from the rest of the world take on the power of the Titans and rise up to end the Olympian gods.

**Mythic Persia,** where Mythenders bind djinn into themselves and fight to destroy the gods that forced their people to war.

**Mythic China,** where a different kind of mortal, the Mythbinders, force the Celestial Bureaucracy to not stray from serving mortalkind.

**Mythic Japan,** where power is bestowed to a handful of mortals during the Mejii Restoration, thanks to oni-slaying rifles.
Mythic Inca, where Mythenders swore to make themselves as kings and masters over Myth, to force the Mythic World to kneel to the might of mortals.

**Mythic Yorùbá,** where Mythenders must fight against their own divine mirrors, forged by the World’s spirit of predestination.

The **Mythic Deep,** where lesser Myths known as the Merfolk seek to become mortals and free themselves from their monstrous oppressors.

And even the **Mythic Now,** where Myths have reborn into strange, new gods, and the descendants of ancient Mythenders awaken to fight off this new-old threat.

## Mythenders: Archons of Destruction

### You are…

…a walking slayer of gods, a force of nature. You are a living blizzard of chaos and doom. You are destruction incarnate. You leave in your wake the broken bodies and spirits of the Mythic World’s nightmares.

…an independent being. No one is master over you. The only equals you know are other Mythenders.You go where you choose, you do what you will, for whatever reasons you hold.

…a cursed soul. You are damned to become the thing you hate most: a monster, a god, a Myth. Either this or death await you; there is no future life of peace.

…a lonely mortal, still capable of feeling. You seem inhuman to all mortalkind, but you still have the soul that knows joy and pain. If you ever lose that, you will fall and become a Myth.

…a badass motherfucker with a complicated existence. Enough said.

### Your Weapons

Mythenders may carry swords, spears, axes, or any other implements of war, but these are merely tools. Your true power lies in what are known as your _Weapons_—iconic elements given glorious purpose through stolen Mythic Power. It’s with these Weapons that you have the might to slaughter the Mythic World.

Some of you hold their superior training and talent as a Weapon. That you are the best swordsman or tactician is in and of itself a Weapon. Everything in your hands becomes an instrument of destruction because you see the lethality in all things.

Others of you wield deep convictions and emotions as Weapons. Through hatred, sorrow, or righteous belief, your hands can be made to punch through any armor.

Some of you possess sorcerous gifts only made possible by your stolen power. Mastery of lightning and fire, the gift of speaking to spirits and making them heed your commands, and many other effects from your sheer force of will are all possible within the Mythic World.

You might possess items that are truly important to you: heirlooms, gifts from mentors and leaders, even those forged from earlier kills and rights of passage. The sheer importance turns these relics into something far more than they once were, coursing with power and savagery, be they swords, books, jewelry, or crowns.

Some mortals will vow to you, sundering forever their free will to accept the Mythic Power that you possess. You may command vast armies, a handful of skilled warriors, or beasts of the forest. You may have even captured and bound Myths to your service, in exchange for sparing their lives…for now.

### Your Fate

The very Mythic Power that enables you to End these gods and monsters will also be your downfall. The Mythic World pumps into you dreams of becoming a horrible god, and with every beat of your Heart, fights inside you to consume whatever’s left of your mortal soul.

Unless you die a mortal death, it will win, for you can never again become purely mortal. Perhaps if you destroy everything in the Mythic World, you’ll regain that precious mortality, but that is a long road with an uncertain end.

This corruption continually emanates from you, making you a walking scar upon the land. Your very presence turns the world a little more extreme, more Mythic—storms forever surrounding you, animals going feral, the spirits of the dead rising and speaking to mortals, or people forced to feel things just because you walk into a village.

Because of this, all mortals know you instantly as a Mythender. They fear you, as well they should—you can slaughter every single one of them without effort, and the Mythic World would reward you for such horrible acts.

And as you take on more and more power, through battle and through terrorizing mortals for power, if you so choose, your physical body changes to become more horrific, more inhuman. In this change, you are less able to resist the corrupting effects of your power, and each step down that dangerous road means a step closer to dark apotheosis.

Yet, if you do not take on this power, you will fail in your quest to rid mortals of Mythickind.

The only way you can fight against the corrupting influence is to keep reconnecting with mortals, to remind your Mythic heart of its mortal heritage. And that means going to mortals who fear you for the destructive, alien force of nature that you are.

### How did I Become a Mythender?

Becoming a Mythender starts with a catastrophic change. Great loss, unquenchable desire, even death itself can turn a mortal into a Mythender. Uncountable stories describe the genesis of a Mythender, but there is always one thing that’s the same: your heart stops for a moment, lying silent in your chest. When it starts again, a fire burns with each beat. That is the lifeblood of the Mythic World mixing with yours.

Once this happens, everything changes. Your mortal heart forever stops, and your Mythic Heart begins to beat. This is the one thing in all the Worlds that cannot be undone.

## Powers & Strengths

### You can end Myths

You and your kind are the only beings in existence that can kill and unmake gods and monsters.You are the only beings that can attack and destroy the entire world of Myth.

### You have strength and will beyond mortalkind

You are stronger, faster, and more resilient than any mortal, thanks to your Mythic Heart. You can level towns and slaughter mortal armies with only slight effort.

### Your are nearly immortal

You are invulnerable to any harm from mortalkind. Only a Myth or fellow Mythender has a chance of killing you, and even then it is with great effort and risk. Any wounds that do not kill you are healed within minutes. Even time itself will not harm you—you’ve become an ageless being.

### You know hidden knowledge upon sight

With just a glimpse, you know the name and surface thought of every mortal you see. With a moment’s concentration, you can see into the heart and past of a mortal. You know truth from lie, fact from delusion.You also know a Myth and those with Mythic power upon sight, as well as the eddies of magic and will that surround a Blight.

### You can perform miracles

You can heal the sick, raise the recently dead, summon or beat back raging storms, conjure or calm infernos, will or dismiss plague and famine, and so much more—powers granted by your Fate. It need only take a moment to ask your Mythic Heart for the power, and your will shall be done.

### You can draw power through fear and worship

You share with Myths the ability to take more power from mortal fear and worship. Terrorizing them or performing grand miracles will corrupt you, but bring with it the power to continue your battles.

### You can attempt to bond with mortals

You can spend time with mortals, to get to know them, and to try to get them to see the man or woman that you are. When you do, the sympathy a mortal shows will calm your Heart, bringing you back from the precipice of Myth. But you risk destroying mortals as you open up to them.

## Burdens & Limitaions

### You can never disguise yourself

You cannot change your form to appear as another being, nor pretend that you are mortal or wholly of Norden. Every mortal and Myth instantly knows your name, and mortals know to address you as Lord or Lady Mythender.

### You can never hide

You cannot escape notice, for the power of your Heart will not allow it. It is like an ever- burning lantern in the minds of those around you. Even if you cannot be immediately seen, your presence cannot help but be felt.

### You cannot easily undo a Blight

Your power does not allow you to casually sweep aside a Blight—a moment where Norden puts its full force to bear to terrorize mortals. You may push back against these Blights with miracles of your own, but such things will tax you and tempt you into drawing more power from your Mythic Heart. And should you ignore these moments, the terror they inspire in mortals will fuel the Myths you will fight.

### You cannot bond with mortals easily

You need the friendship and sympathy of mortals to keep yourself from becoming a Myth, but they all fear you. From the first moment a mortal sees you, they see only a fearful titan that can rip their world asunder.You will need to fight to gain their trust and understanding, and you will have to do so without any of your Heart’s powers.

### You cannot avoid drawing power from mortals

You will draw power from mortals, even when you don’t want to. You will cause fear and worship when you perform miracles in front of them. And when you do, you will taste what Mythstaste—thepowermortalscangiveyou.Perhapsyouwilldothisintentionally;perhaps you will always try to avoid this. But you cannot stop the flow of power and corruption that comes from acting in the eyes of mortals.

### You cannot avoid the witness of mortals

This becomes the most dangerous limitation of all. Every time you act with your Mythic Heart—battle, perform miracles, fight Blights—Fate will ensure that mortals will witness your deeds. And Fate will make sure you feel them as they bow to your power. There is no privacy for a Mythender, not when it’s most important.

### You cannot escape fate

You will either die by the hands of another Mythic being, or you will fall and become a Myth. And even then, you will eventually die at the hands of another Mythender.You will be killed by one of your own—a thought your Heart reminds you of every night. The question is: how much can you do before that comes to pass?

### You cannot commit suicide

To do either is to cheat you Fate, and your Heart will not have that. Or, to be truthful, you _can_ kill yourself or allow another to kill you, but if outside of Battle or Murder, you will rise immediately after.

# What you Need to Play

## Players & Characters

### Players

<span class="mythender">Mythender</span> takes four to five players: three to four playing the roles of Mythenders, and one playing the role of the Mythmaster—the person who will play out the Mythic World and everyone else inside it. (The rules for being a Mythmaster are found in the **Being a Mythmaster** chapter.)

This game does not work well for more than four Mythenders. And by “not work well” I mean “you will have a horrible time.”

For variants allowing for fewer Mythenders, see **Different Numbers of Mythenders**.

### Characters

Each person playing a Mythender will need a Mythender created, either fresh or a pre-generated Mythender. The Mythmaster will need some Myths ready to be Ended, and a list of names for mortals encountered.

If you’re playing in Mythic Norden, the stuff for the Mythmaster is already made in that chapter.

### The Table

This game requires you to use playsheets—paper that you’ll put dice and tokens on, and write on and erase throughout play.You’ll need a flat surface for each person. In addition, the dice and tokens are communal; all the players, including the Mythmaster, share them as they gain and lose things. So, this game is best played around a table where everyone can reach things and have enough surface area for their playsheets.

### Hands

This game requires hands. That might be weird to say, but it’s important to note because Mythender uses tactile experiences to enhance play—holding a fistful of dice is fun!

While you’re always free to play this over voice chat services and online die rollers, you might find the game lesser fun than if you’re holding your Mythender’s ultimate might in your very hands. Plus, an online die roller will probably be a pain in the ass to constantly tweak for your constantly changing multi-colored die pools.

### Fair Warning!

<span class="mythender">Mythender</span> has quite a few moving parts! Don’t worry, each one has a space on the playsheets (see below) to help you play the game. Using all this is explained later in the rules. For now, you should just know what materials you’ll need for play.

## Dice & Tokens

All the many dice of Mythender are six-sided dice.You’ll need four different sorts of dice: three of them should be smaller dice, of three different colors; one type should be larger and heavier.

### Storm Dice

Storm dice are represented by white dice: ![ ](/catalog/creators/ryan-macklin/mythender/storm-1.svg) ![ ](/catalog/creators/ryan-macklin/mythender/storm-2.svg) ![ ](/catalog/creators/ryan-macklin/mythender/storm-3.svg) ![ ](/catalog/creators/ryan-macklin/mythender/storm-4.svg) ![ ](/catalog/creators/ryan-macklin/mythender/storm-5.svg) ![ ](/catalog/creators/ryan-macklin/mythender/storm-6.svg). You’ll need 30-40 in order for everyone to hold onto their dice. If you have fewer, you can share, but you may need as many as 15 at any given point.

### Thunder Dice

Thunder dice are represented by black dice: ![ ](/catalog/creators/ryan-macklin/mythender/thunder-1.svg) ![ ](/catalog/creators/ryan-macklin/mythender/thunder-2.svg) ![ ](/catalog/creators/ryan-macklin/mythender/thunder-3.svg) ![ ](/catalog/creators/ryan-macklin/mythender/thunder-4.svg) ![ ](/catalog/creators/ryan-macklin/mythender/thunder-5.svg) ![ ](/catalog/creators/ryan-macklin/mythender/thunder-6.svg). You’ll need at least a hundred for the group, the more the better. Holding onto your own Thunder dice is a key part of the game. If you run out of Thunder dice, use some sort of counter to keep track of how many you have, as it constantly changes with every turn.

### Bonus Dice

Bonus Thunder dice are represented by red dice: ![ ](/catalog/creators/ryan-macklin/mythender/bonus-1.svg) ![ ](/catalog/creators/ryan-macklin/mythender/bonus-2.svg) ![ ](/catalog/creators/ryan-macklin/mythender/bonus-3.svg) ![ ](/catalog/creators/ryan-macklin/mythender/bonus-4.svg) ![ ](/catalog/creators/ryan-macklin/mythender/bonus-5.svg) ![ ](/catalog/creators/ryan-macklin/mythender/bonus-6.svg). You’ll only need ten or twelve for the group, as they aren’t held onto when a turn is over.

There are times when you’ll also get bonus Storm dice, but for those you’ll use the same white dice as normal Storm. Thunder is kept track of from one moment to the next.

### The Mythic Die

The Mythic die is represented by a larger die than all the others: ![ ](/catalog/creators/ryan-macklin/mythender/mythic-6.svg). Having one die is enough, though if each Mythender has their own Mythic die, all the better.

### Lightning Tokens

Lightning is represented by tokens. You’ll need at least a hundred, though it’s easy to do if you have some that represent 1 Lightning and some that represent 10 Lightning. Plastic crystals that are sold in many hobby stores are cheap and come in different sizes. And they look a little like captured lightning, with the right imagination.

### Might Tokens

Might is also represented by tokens. You’ll need around 70, though you can make that easier by splitting them up into denominations of 1 and 5. Metal coins make great Might tokens— pennies and nickels and easy to get, or get some fancy metal gaming coins.

### Holy Crap! That’s a Lot of Stuff!

If that’s too many dice for you, go and have fun with a different game. No hard feelings; no game is for everyone. But if you want to embrace rolling fistfuls of dice while shouting “I’MMA KILL YOUR FACE ODIN!” then you’ve come to the right place.

#### Material Suggestions

12mm dice are great for Storm, Thunder, and bonus Thunder dice. You might be rolling 40 dice during later actions, so have dice that fit in your hands. Have something at least twice as large or heavy for Mythic dice. My favorite are stone dice from the Smithsonian Natural History Museum.

## Mythender Playsheets

Each person playing a Mythender needs a <span class="keyword">Mythender playsheet</span>. It’s called a playsheet because you’ll set it on the table and play on it, like a little paper board or place mat.

The game has a number of moving parts that constantly change during every turn, requiring you to grab or put back different dice and tokens, as well as remember how many you have at any given time. The corners give you a place to put these dice and tokens so that you remember what they’re called while playing the game.

You’ll also need to check boxes and occasionally erase the checks, as you gain and lose things over the course of an adventure. So make sure you’re using pencil while playing.

You’ll fill in the sheet in **Creating Your Mythender**. The sheet has a few quick reference boxes, so that you don’t have to keep looking up basic options.

    Thunder Dice based on your current Form level:
    Mortal = 1, Paragon = 2, Supernatural = 4, Godly = 6

### Parts of the Playsheet

How each of these parts work are covered in chapters to come, but here are the basics:

<span class="keyword">Name</span>: at the top, you’ll write your character’s name, your name as the player, and the Past, Heart, and Fate chosen during Mythender creation.

<span class="keyword">Dice & Tokens</span>: on each corner is a space for you to keep your Storm dice, Thunder dice, Lightning tokens, and Might tokens separate. There are quick references to remind you how they work.

<span class="keyword">Wounds</span>: here’s where you’ll keep track of when you’re Wounded in battle, and your Wound Cost, which is always 3 for Mythenders.

<span class="keyword">Weapons</span>: these are your three Weapons, used in battle against Myths. They charge and drain as you fight.

<span class="keyword">Mythic Corruption & Forms</span>: these are your telltale signs of corruption.Your Mortal Form is how you look normally. The Personal Blight is the effect you constantly have around you. Your Paragon, Supernatural, and Godly Forms are what you become as you check the Corruption boxes to the left of them. And your Fate’s Power is the thing that your Mythic Heart allows you to do.

<span class="keyword">Fate</span>: to the far right, this track shows how much mortality you’ve lost and how close you are to becoming a god. If you check far enough down to the boxes with numbers, you’ll have to roll a die at the end of a battle to see if you become a god.

The first one is permanent, so it is star red to let you know that you cannot lose it.

<span class="keyword">Gifts</span>: next to each line on the track is a slot for a Gift. Gifts change how the rules work for you in a battle, and most require you to spend Might tokens to use.

<span class="keyword">Numbers</span>: the numbers next to your Forms are <span class="keyword">Corruption numbers</span>, and on the Fate track are <span class="keyword">Apotheosis numbers</span>. These show how close to becoming a Myth you are.

## Mythender Persona Sheets

Each person playing a Mythender may also get a <span class="keyword">Persona Sheet</span>. You’ll use this during Mythender creation to answer the questions about your character.

<span class="keyword">Name</span>: this is the same as on the playsheet.

<span class="keyword">Heart’s Questions</span>: the Heart you pick will have three questions. Here, you’ll write down the questions and their answers.

<span class="keyword">Past’s Questions</span>: the Past you pick will also have three questions. As with Hearts, you’ll write down the questions and their answers.

<span class="keyword">Fate’s Dream</span>: the Fate you pick will haunt you every night with a dream of the god you’re destined to become. Here, you’ll write that dream down.

_Note_: if you’re doing quick Mythender creation, you won’t need this sheet. It’s there for when you can take the time to fully flesh out your Mythender’s background, motivations, and nature.

## Myth Playsheets

As the Mythmaster, you’ll need a <span class="keyword">Myth Playsheet</span> for each foe the characters will face. These are similar to the Mythender playsheets, so that you and the other players use the same sort of setup during battle.

Each Myth has a different set of stats and Weapons. The Myths for Mythic Norden are detailed in their own chapter. There’s advice for making your own Myths in the Mythmaster’s chapter.

### Parts of the Playsheet

How each of these parts work are covered in chapters to come, but here are the basics:

<span class="keyword">Name & Description</span>: at the top, you’ll write the Myth’s name or title and its description.

<span class="keyword">Dice & Tokens</span>: on each corner is a space for you to keep the Myth’s Storm dice, Thunder dice, Lightning tokens, and Might tokens separate. There’s also a quick reference to remind you how they work.

The Storm rating, starting Thunder and Might, and Might recharge vary for each Myth. Note that Myths have a Might Recharge section and Mythenders don’t.

<span class="keyword">Wounds</span>: here’s where you’ll keep track of when the Myth is Wounded in battle, and its Wound Cost, which varies for each Myth.

The Wound cost, number of boxes, and their corresponding Wound numbers vary for each Myth.

<span class="keyword">Weapons</span>: these are the Myth’s Weapons, used in battle against Mythenders.

Lesser Myths only have three Weapons. Gods and Greater Myths have four, and have some Weapons more powerful than others.

<span class="keyword">Gathering Rage</span>: different effects are triggered at the end of each round, if the Myth is still alive. Battles always end after five rounds; if they last that long, the Mythenders have given the Myth too much time.

<span class="keyword">Gifts</span>: as with Mythenders, Gifts allow the Myth to change how the rules work for them in a battle, and most require spending Might tokens to trigger. Lesser Myths have three or four Gifts, while Greater Myths have more.

#### Lesser Myths & the Myth Playsheet

Since Lesser Myths have fewer Wound boxes, Weapons, and Gifts, when you’re making a sheet for one, cross out what you’re not using, so it’s clear to everyone.

## Bonds Sheets

Mythenders are bonded to one another through how they feel…or, more importantly, why they don’t either walk away from or murder each other. These are represented by their Bonds. These Bonds are recorded on the group’s <span class="keyword">Bonds Sheet</span>.

The group shares one Bonds sheet, as a symbol that they are together to End Myths. During Mythender creation, you’ll come up with these bonds. In case you’re wondering how these might be used in play, they’re used when you decide to break these Bonds by **Murdering Another Mythender**.

> `____________________`’s Bonds

## Blight Cards & Other Things

### Blight Cards

Another part of <span class="mythender">Mythender</span> are Blights, Mythic scars on the land that continually gushes power (see **Blights**). Both Mythenders and Myths create, manipulate, and destroy Blights. These are recorded on <span class="keyword">Blight Cards</span>.

Unlike playsheets, you don’t put dice or tokens on these cards. They’re meant to be handed around as they’re used and ripped up when destroyed. You can easily make rough versions of these with index cards or pieces of paper.

> **BLIGHT** ☐ Lasting

>
> **When you use this Blight in battle**, you may either:

> - Charge a box to gain one bonus Storm die.
> - Or drain all charged boxes for that many bonus Thunder dice.

#### Parts of the Card

<span class="keyword">Description</span>: here you’ll write what the Blight looks like.

<span class="keyword">Created by</span>: write who created this Blight, as a Myth’s Blight can only be used by a Myth, and a Mythender’s Blight can only be used by that or another Mythender.

<span class="keyword">Lasting</span>: you’ll mark if this Blight is persistent; otherwise, it goes away after a Battle.

<span class="keyword">Charges</span>: as the Blight is used, it will be charged and drained.

### Other Things

You may want to use paper for other bits, like recording the names of mortals that the Mythenders don’t just immediately slaughter.

### References

You might want to print out and have handy the following:

- **Creating Your Mythender** (useful as a quick reference)
- **Battle in Brief**
- **Moments in Brief**

# Creating Your Mythender

## Creating Your Mythender

Before you create your Mythender, read the **What is Mythender?** chapter, to understand what Mythenders are.

To make your Mythender, start by picking three things out from lists—your Mythender’s Heart, Past, and Fate. Those will give you the basis for your character. From there, come up with your Weapons, Forms, and Bonds with the other Mythenders. Then finish up with some final things to note down, and you’re ready to play.

You will need a Mythender persona sheet and playsheet for each character, and the Bonds sheet for the group.

> ##### Choosing your Heart, Past & Fate
>
> Each Mythender has a Heart, Past, and Fate—what sort of Mythender you are and what sort of mortal you were before gaining your Mythic Heart, and what kind of god you’re fated to become. After you’ve chosen them, you’ll answer the questions they list.
>
> ##### Forging Your Weapons
>
> Each Mythender has three special ways that they project the power to sunder gods.You’ll come up with your Weapons—talents, emotions, items of power, or allies and traveling companions. Your Heart and Past have suggestions for Weapons to get you started.
>
> ##### Damning Your Mythender
>
> Each Mythender is constantly tempted by the draw of Mythic Power to become a god: a Myth. Your Fate has a dark dream of apotheosis you have every night, and two different takes on the horror that you’ll become as you take in more of the Mythic power.
>
> ##### Bonding to the Others
>
> Traveling with other powerful god- and monster-slayers is no small deal. What it is about the others that makes you want to journey with them, rather than leave them or kill them so they do not become Myths? The Past you chose will have Bonds listed on it.
>
> ##### Finishing Up
>
> The last things you’ll need are to write down your first Gift, your base Storm rating, and your starting Might.

### Mythenders & Religion

Some people wonder if Mythenders can be religious or spiritual, like worshipping the Norse gods, Christianity, Islam, Zoroastrianism, Hinduism, whatever. Mythenders aren’t inherently atheists. You could always worship a god of gods that you want to see not Ended. Or worship gods that you do want to see Ended. Mythenders aren’t simple beings.

Some people also wonder if you can End the God of Abraham. Fuck, you’re a Mythender; who’s gonna tell you “no?”

### Full Mythender Creation

If you have time, ninety minutes or so, you can do full Mythender creation—where you write down the answers to each question in your Heart and Past, come up with your own Weapons and Fate, and fill in all the Bonds. Use the persona sheet for the Heart and Past answers, and for your Fate’s Dream.

The pages for your Heart and Past have blank spaces under the questions so that you can print them out from the PDF and fill them in, if you’d prefer to do that.

### Quick Mythender Creation

If you don’t have time for full Mythender creation, such as if you’re running a single session at a convention, you can do the quick method that involves just thinking briefly about each question, picking Weapons from your lists, using the Fate exactly as listed, and choosing only one Bond. Each section will tell you how to do the quick method. You don’t need personal sheets for this method.

If you do this, you can always revise your Mythender later if you’re going to play again (provided he or she survives), or fill in Bonds during play.

### Revising in Play

Sometimes, an idea you have at character creation just doesn’t work in play. A Weapon might end up sucking, or a Form doesn’t play as interesting as you first thought it would. When that happens, revise it in play! Just take a moment to narrate how your character changes in that moment—maybe a dull Weapon transforms into something more interesting, or that more interesting one is just found on the ground thanks to destiny.

Likewise, you can leave things blank, as long as you’re willing to deal with having to make up new stuff on the spot during play.

This should give you the freedom to not struggle too hard with ideas. If you’re not feeling enough inspiration to finish your character before playing, let playing further inspire you.

### The Popular Culture Method

Another way to go about doing character creation is to first talk a bit about what Mythenders are and the premise of the game, and then ask them about pop culture characters they want to pattern after. With those touchstones, the Mythmaster can walk through character creation with the players, helping them make choices that make sense for their touchstone.

Namely, the Mythmaster can pick appropriate Hearts, Pasts, and Fates, and help come up with Weapons and Forms appropriate to that idea. This is sometimes easier than coming up with a full Mythender concept from scratch, if a player is interested in this idea.

## Choosing your Heart, Past & Fate

The first step to creating your Mythender is picking your Mythender’s Heart, Past, and Fate. Choosing these will inform the rest of character creation.

You can choose these in any order. For some people, it makes sense to choose the sort of badass character they are right away (Heart); for others, they like to start with the origin of the person (Past). _Just make sure you choose all three before proceeding further!_

If you’re new to <span class="mythender">Mythender</span>, just pick whichever sounds coolest or most exciting. Don’t worry about the details.

The following are listed in the order I like to present them to new players.

### Heart

Your Heart tells everyone what sort of badass godkiller you are. Each one has a description, three questions to answer, some ideas for Weapons, and your first Gift.

**Warrior**, _who values the power of skill and might_

**Crusader**, _who values the power of belief and conviction_

**Commander**, _who values the power of men and trust_

**Bearer**, _who values the power of relics and destiny_

**Tempest**, _who values the power of magic and sacrifice_

**Loremaster**, _who values the power of intellect and patience_

### Past

Your Past tells everyone what sort of person you were before becoming a Mythender. Each one has a description, three questions to answer, some more ideas for Weapons, and your Bonds.

**Noble**, _who knows the pressures of ruling and the expectations of a people_

**Child**, _who has suffered unimaginable cruelties and is forever hardened_

**Mourner**, _who has brought loss upon himself and bears a heavy cross_

**Apostate**, _who once served the Mythic world’s gods before seeing them for what they are_

**Exile**, _who had been apart from mortals long before becoming a Mythender_

**Abomination**, _who struggles with both his mortal and Mythic parentage_

### Fate

Your Fate tells everyone what sort of god you will become when all humanity is lost and you join the ranks of the Mythic world. You have had a dream every night of the god you’ll become, and this Fate curses you with the blight, forms, and powers from that impending apotheosis.

**God of Judgment**, _who will pass judgment and enforce order throughout the worlds_

**God of Death**, _who will rule viciously over the souls of the departed_

**God of War**, _who will forever drench mankind in the blood of their foes and fellows_

**God of Life**, _who will shape the cycle of creation with a firm hand_

**God of Love**, _who will force all hearts to wear chains of devotion and need_

**God of Chaos**, _who will doom mortalkind to the beautiful whims of entropy and chance_

### Advice for Getting Things Started

A great way to put these choices out there for the players is to print out their sheets, cut them down the middle to separate each pair of Heart, Past, and Fate, and read out the short descriptor while putting the sheets down in the middle of the table. Have them pick up the pages and look them over, and write directly on them rather than a separate Persona sheet. This does mean that unless you print out multiples, you’ll only have one page for each option—though, I’ve never found that to be a problem.

### Advice if Players Get Stuck

Sometimes people will get hung up on a piece of character creation, most often what one of the Heart or Past questions means. You should interpret those as you will; nothing is worth getting bogged down over. Make a short, quick decision and move on, then come back to that if you need to change it or flesh it out. And please, feel free to ask everyone at the table for ideas! Several of you are, just by nature, going to be more creative than one person alone.

#### Going Too Far

All that said, don’t jump the gun and offer advice before someone else has asked. Some people just take a bit to think or articulate ideas. Slow your roll and gave them that space. Whatever you do, don’t say “You know what would be more awesome…” That sort of language shuts down people by invalidating their ideas—and that’s not awesome.

### Making Your Own Heart, Past & Fate

If you’ve played <span class="mythender">Mythender</span> before and have more time to make your character, you might have fun with making a Heart, Past, or Fate! See the advice at the end of each of those sections (pages 46, 54, and 62) for guidance and things to think about.

## Forging Your Weapons

There are three things so important to you as a Mythender that your Mythic Heart has given them power in battle. These Weapons are what you use to unmake these so-called gods.

### Types of Weapons

There are three types of Weapons: <span class="keyword">Intrinsic</span>, <span class="keyword">Relic</span>, and <span class="keyword">Companion</span>.

<span class="keyword">Intrinsic Weapons</span> are qualities from within that you constantly demonstrate against your foes. Intrinsic Weapons can take the form of skills, others are emotions, talents, beliefs, etc.

     My Infallible Skill with the Sword …is my weapon
      ☒ Intrinsic  ☐ Relic  ☐ Companion
     The Rage of a Dying People …is my weapon
      ☒ Intrinsic  ☐ Relic  ☐ Companion
     My Command over Wind Itself …is my weapon
      ☒ Intrinsic  ☐ Relic  ☐ Companion

<span class="keyword">Relic Weapons</span> are items of power that have personal meaning. Relic Weapons can take the form of literal weapons, holy symbols, heirlooms, mysterious artifacts, etc.

     My Father’s Mace …is my weapon
      ☐ Intrinsic  ☒ Relic  ☐ Companion
     The Legendary Stone of Fire …is my weapon
      ☐ Intrinsic  ☒ Relic  ☐ Companion
     My Grandmother’s Book of Law …is my weapon
      ☐ Intrinsic  ☒ Relic  ☐ Companion

<span class="keyword">Companion Weapons</span> are those who travel with you, cursed or blessed to never leave your side and to die for you. Companion Weapons can take the form of mortals, animals, armies, Mythic beings, etc.

     My attendant, Battlemaster Wilhelm …is my weapon
      ☐ Intrinsic  ☐ Relic  ☒ Companion
     My trusted warhorse, Firebrand …is my weapon
      ☐ Intrinsic  ☐ Relic  ☒ Companion
     The horde of orphans that follow me …is my weapon
      ☐ Intrinsic  ☐ Relic  ☒ Companion

#### Restrictions on Weapon Types

When making your three Weapons, they cannot be all of the same type. You may have two of one type and one of another, or all three of different types.

### Coming Up With Your Weapons

Your Heart and Past have ideas for Weapons. Use them as-is, tweak them to fit your character, or come up with other ideas that make you eager to End Myths.

Write your Weapons by filling in the line “`____________` …is my Weapon.” Make each one personal. These aren’t just anyone’s Weapons. They’re yours.

#### Picking a Good Weapon

When it comes to making a good Weapon, ask yourself for each one: _“How will I complete destroy gods and monsters with this Weapon?”_

If you know the answer, it’s probably a good Weapon. If you don’t, then it’s certainly not.

#### How much detail for each Weapon?

Put as much detail as you like, whatever is enough to inspire you to play an exciting godkiller, and whatever’s enough to make it clear what that Weapon means to everyone else at the table. If you find that you added too much or not enough to your idea, change it in play.

#### Look at the other Hearts & Pasts

The other Hearts and Pasts may have Weapon ideas that fit your concept, or may inspire more ideas. Don’t feel restricted to just your lists.

#### Quick Weapon Creation

If you’re doing quick creation, pick three Weapons from your lists. You can tweak them if inspiration immediately strikes, such as changing “My Father’s Mace” to “My Mother’s Mace” or “My Mentor’s Lance.” If you immediately have an idea for a Weapon that isn’t on that list, then go ahead and write it down.

Often, people will have a strong, original idea for one or two Weapons on short notice. The lists exist so that you can come up with all three within five minutes. Don’t worry about them fitting perfectly to a vision; either you’ll discover how that Weapon works, or you’ll come up with a new idea during play.

If you absolutely cannot come up with an idea and cannot make any of the Weapons on your lists fit your concept, you can leave one Weapon blank, to be filled in during play.

### Your Weapons Are Inseparable

Your Mythic Heart is connected to these Weapons just as it is connected to you. Your Weapons can never be truly lost or stolen. One may be briefly knocked out of your hands or otherwise momentarily denied, but only until you choose to regain it. You might wait to regain your weapon simply to create an opportunity to fight your way to regain something personally connected to you and to show the Mythic World that you will not be stopped.

### Differences Between Weapon Types

If you’re curious, you can find out more about the differences between Intrinsic, Relic, and Companion Weapons in **The Weapon Types**.

### Changing Weapons During Play

Your Weapons can change! See **Changing Weapons** for more on that.

## Damning Your Mythender

Your Mythic Heart corrupts you with every beat. It haunts your dreams, twists the world around you, and slowly changes you into the vile Myth it demands you to be. You are cursed and damned by this Fate.

### Your Mortal Form

It’s important to note how you appear normally, since that changes as you become more Mythic. In the Mortal Form box, write down a few words about what’s notable: are you a large or small person? Do you wear anything special? Do you have any markings? What does your skin and hair look like?

### Your Fate

You know that your Fate is to become a god, and are reminded of this every night by your Dream, every day by your Personal Blight, and every time you steal Mythic power by the way your appearance changes to be less mortal.

The Fate you chose earlier has two different takes on all this filled out for you. Pick one.

#### Your Dream

Every night, your Heart sings a lullaby of temptation and power, a glimpse of your beautiful and horrific future. This is your Fate’s Dream. These are not nightmares; those scared by such a dream lack the will to be a Mythender. But it never relents. Sleep offers no respite from your trials.

#### Your Personal Blight

Your Fate constantly leaks into the world around you, making a small but noticeable impact everywhere you go. This is your Personal Blight. It’s a constant effect that alters one thing, be it weather, animals, or mortal feelings. You may never turn this off, though you may use it to power your fight against gods.

On your playsheet, the Personal Blight space ends with <span class="keyword">…in my presence</span> to remind you that it’s a permanent, horrific effect you’re powerless to stop.

_Multiple Mythenders and Contradicting Blights_: if the Mythenders have personal blights that contradict one another, cool! Totally workable. Whoever is the focus in the moment has the dominant effect.

#### Your Forms

As you take on more Mythic Power, your physical form changes to become more like the god in your Dream. Your Fate lists the three forms you’ll take as you gain Corruption.

The <span class="keyword">Paragon Form</span> is the first step, like a perfect human, with one twist of the divine. The <span class="keyword">Supernatural Form</span> is the second step, crossing further into Myth. The <span class="keyword">Godly Form</span> is the final step, where you appear just as the god in your Dream.

On your playsheet, each Form space starts with <span class="keyword">I appear as…</span> to remind you that this is only how you appear, and not how you’re forced to act.

This is not a one-way process. If you take time to gain mortal sympathy and heal your soul (**Seeking Sympathy & Healing**), you’ll start to slide back down toward your Mortal Form again.

#### Your Powers Over Mortals and the Land

Being a short leap from apotheosis comes with access to great power, feats you can perform that fall under your future godhood’s domain. Your Fate offers some options, but this isn’t a comprehensive list; if some action or effect feels related to your domain, you can probably claim the ability and privilege to do that as well.

On your playsheet, the Fate’s Power space starts with <span class="keyword">My Fate allows me to…</span> to remind you that this is granted by the Mythic World, and always has a price.

### Personal Blights, Powers, Mythenders & Myths

You and other Mythenders are not directly affected by your Personal Blight or your Powers, so they will not feel any emotions or be stopped by any foul weather you cause. Likewise, your Companions are unaffected, unless for some reason you will them to be. Myths aren’t affected by them unless you incorporate them into some form of attack or onslaught.

### Making Your own Fate

If you have time for full character creation, you might want to make your own Fate. Tweak the ones in this book or use them as inspiration and examples for inventing all new ones.

#### Your Dream

Come up with something alien and extreme. Gods aren’t moderate beings by nature. Describe it on your personal sheet.

#### Your Personal Blight

Describe a single thing that happens constantly around you that’s either: a phenomenon or weather element, an animal oddity or behavior, or one emotion felt in mortals. Don’t force mortals to do something or kill them with your Personal Blight; that’s what your Fate’s Powers are for.

#### Your Forms

The three Forms all progress from minor changes to becoming the god in your Fate’s Dream. When coming up with your Paragon Form, make one single change to your Mortal Form (i.e. having a halo, your skin turning blue, or growing in size). For your Supernatural Form, add a couple more changes that clearly make you a frightening demigod. Your Godly Form is that which is in your Dream.

Only describe how you appear, now how others treat or react to you, or how the world changes around you. Describing those things are the Mythmaster’s job.

#### Your Powers Over Mortals and the Land

Your Powers should be linked to the sort of god you’ll become. Look at these listed with the available Fates and choose ones in similar scope that fall under your future godhood’s domain. The Powers listed in this book are just suggestions.

#### Leaving Things Blank

If you really need to, leave some parts of your Fate blank. But know that if you’re struggling to come up with a good idea right now, you may also struggle when you need to in the middle of a battle, so it’s worth taking some extra time now to fill those in.

## Bonding to the Others

### First, a Name

Before you can deal with the Bonding process, you and your fellow Mythenders all need names. If you’re making a character from Mythic Norden, there are some names in its chapter, **People of Norden**. Otherwise, pick a name from wherever your Mythender is from or whatever your character chose to renaming him- or herself.

Sometimes a Mythender use a title or epithet, such as the Deathwatcher, of the Southern Blade, Prince of the Forgotten, the Eternal Fire, She who Brings the Stars, the Shrouded, Warlord of all Haleish, the Flood of Lamentation, and so on.

If you’re drawing a blank, and random name generators and books like the _Story Games Names Project_ don’t help, consider the name “Ryan.” It’s a fantastic name for someone who feels like killing a god.

### Choosing Your Bonds

If you have been doing Mythender creation alone, stop now and do the rest of this process together as a group. This is where the **Bonds Sheet** will come in.

Going around the table, one player at a time will pick one of the Bonds from their History and write it down on his corner of the Bonds Sheet, filling in the line:

<span class="keyword">I hesitate to murder `_______________________` because:</span>

With the name of another Mythender and describe the Bond. Each time someone makes a Bond, talk briefly about it. This is about that relationship, and has some element that is specific to that person, so it’s important for both players to be on the same page regarding these Bonds. Be open and flexible.

At the end of this, every Mythender will have a Bond with every other Mythender.

#### Quick Bond Creation

If you are doing this quickly, then just pick a bond with the player to your left. That means the player to your right will pick one with you. Fill in the names of the other Mythenders, but leave the reason you hesitate to murder them blank. You can finish those rest in play, if you’re so inspired.

### Prior Relationship Bonds

The Bonds on each Past related to that Past’s general world view. However, none of the Pasts’ Bonds take into account something more personal: relationships between two Mythenders who knew each other before they gained their Mythic Hearts. Some Bonds include:

- <span class="keyword">…is my mother/father/daughter/son/other family member.</span>

- <span class="keyword">…took me in when no one else would.</span>

- <span class="keyword">…and I grew up together/apprenticed to the same master.</span>

- <span class="keyword">…and I both became Mythenders in the very same place and time.</span>

Ask with any Bond, talk with the other player before finalizing this. If you both like this bit of backstory, then great! Write down that Bond. Note that the other person don’t have to write a mirroring Bonds for you—if you write <span class="keyword">I hesitate to murder Erik because he is my son</span>, he don’t have to write <span class="keyword">I hesitate to murder Úlfdís because she is my mother</span>. That player might still use a Bond from her Past, such as <span class="keyword">…because Erik joins me in suffering</span> (for the Mourner) or <span class="keyword">…because Erik reminds me why I rebelled</span>. This is all rich ground for roleplaying opportunities.

### Making Your Own Bonds

When coming up with your own Bonds, look at the other Bonds for guidance. The most important thing to keep in mind is that Bonds are why you actually _like_, _care about_, or _accept_ another Mythender. These should be positive, not antagonistic. If you screw this up and make an antagonistic one, then make sure to set aside time in play to make more Mythenders, because one of you _will_ kill another.

### Boring Bonds are Invalid

If you come up with some bond that isn’t directly involving just one other person and has a kernel of something interesting going on, then it’s not a Bond. (Which means it won’t count when **Murdering Another Mythender**.) This includes someone trying to fill in a Bond with “I hesitate to murder <span class="keyword">everyone</span> because <span class="keyword">I like everyone</span>.” That’s exactly the same as writing nothing down, because that’s not a personal connection with another Mythender. And such a character wouldn’t have any strong reason to be with this group of people, so that answer’s even worse.

## Finishing Up

There are three more things you need to do in order to be done with making your Mythender. Luckily, they’ve already been chosen by now, so you just need to write them down.

### First Gift

    GIFTS           Might Cost
    Relentlessness    2

Your Mythender’s Heart has a Gift listed on it. That Gift is a special trick you have during battle. (Gifts are listed in more detail in their own chapter, **Your Heart’s Gifts**).

Write down your Gift and its Might Cost on the first Gift slot.

Don’t worry about what this means right now. If you’re playing the Tutorial Battle, you’ll learn all about it.

### Storm Rating

    Storm Rating: 3 (Base: 3)

Your Storm rating governs how much raw power you gain each turn in battle just by doing something minor. Every Mythender has a base value of 3, written on the sheet.

If you have the <span class="keyword">Harbinger of Storm</span> gift: write 5 in the Storm rating circle. You get 2 Storm more than normal. If you don’t, write 3 instead.

### Starting Might

At the start of every adventure, a Mythender has 5 Might tokens. If you’re going right from Mythender creation into playing, take your 5 Might tokens now.

### Starting Form

Since you start with no Corruption boxes checked, you start at your Mortal Form. The other Forms will come into play as you check off Corruption.

### Wound Cost & Boxes

    WOUNDS
    ☐ 3
      ↓
    ☐ 4
      ↓
    ☐ 5
      ↓
      6
    Your Wound Cost: 3

Every Mythender has the same <span class="keyword">Wound cost</span> of 3 and the <span class="keyword">Wound boxes</span>, as show here. These are explained in the **Battling Myths & Gods** chapter.

### You’re Done!

And that’s it! Now go End some Myths.

# Mythender Hearts

## Warrior

_who values the power of skill and might_

You are a master of arms. With unmatched prowess on the battlefield, you slice through Mythic armies as though they were parchment. Your versatility is your strength—any blade, bow, or cudgel is a manifestation of death in your hands.

As a Mythender, you understand that your true power to End gods comes from your unmatched skill and willingness to use it.

### Questions

**What skill do you value most?**

**Who forged you into the warrior you are?**

**What honor do you still fight for?**

### Weapon Ideas

- My unmatched talent with any blade (Intrinsic)

- Rodedoorsteken, sword I’ve used in every battle (Relic)
- My squires, Renee and Jonah (Companion)

### First Gift: Relentlessness

Might Cost: 2

Mythenders do not fail to hit their mark. But not every blow comes down with the same power. You can call upon your Heart to make the force of your blow harder, reminding Myths that you will not suffer them.

Gift listed in **Your Heart’s Gifts**.

## Crusader

_who values the power of belief and conviction_

You are an unshakable idealist. You have seen the power of the belief—for Church, kingdom, romance, or ideal—and have discovered how to use that against the Mythic World. Your passion is as sharp as any sword and strikes as true as any arrow.

As a Mythender, you understand that your true power to End gods comes from the strength of your unwavering conviction.

### Questions

**What belief or ideal do you fight for?**

**What happened to make you see the world as unjust?**

**What is the inevitable result of your righteous deeds?**

### Weapon Ideas

- My unshakable faith (Intrinsic)
- My grandfather’s amulet, symbol of freedom (Relic)
- The Spear of Longinus (Relic)
- My war-priest and spiritual advisor, René (Companion)

### First Gift: Bloodlust

Might Cost: 2

When you are Wounded, your Heart rages. It replaces the blood flowing out of you with more of the Mythic World’s own strength, giving you the strength and will to strike back hard at your foe.

Gift listed in **Your Heart’s Gifts**.

## Commander

_who values the power of men and trust_

You are the mind and will of an army. Whether your companions number a dozen or a thousand, they are fierce—a walking reckoning. Be they mortal, animal, or even captured Myths, they are extensions of your campaign against the Mythic World.

As a Mythender, you understand that your true power to End gods comes from your willingness to take on the burden of leadership.

### Questions

**Who follows you into battle?**

**How did you gain your companions?**

**Do you still try to act human around them? Why/why not?**

### Weapon Ideas

- My raw force of charisma and fear (Intrinsic)

- The legion of lost souls that fight for me (Companion)
- The pack of Myth-wolves I have cowed (Companion)

Two blows are better than one. You can draw from your Mythic Heart to strike with preternatural speed, granting you twice the power from your assault.

Gift listed in **Your Heart’s Gifts**.

## Bearer

_who values the power of relics and destiny_

You are a locus of destiny. It was no accident that you encountered your Relic; you were born to End Myths. Your family, mentor, Fate, or the relic itself knew this. But you aren’t simply the plaything of some force. You use this strength to bring about the fate of the Mythic World.

As a Mythender, you understand that your true power to End gods comes from your dominion over your destiny.

### Questions

**How did you gain your relic?**

**What does your relic whisper to you?**

The blows you strike are more vicious than that of your comrades. By pushing your Mythic Heart, you sunder flesh as though it were snow, and the screams of your foes echo throughout the Mythic World’s mountains or skies.

Gift listed in **Your Heart’s Gifts**.

## Tempest

_who values the power of magic and sacrifice_

You are the eye of a living storm. Taking more of the Fate’s Faustian bargain than your comrades, you have stolen some of the Mythic World’s magic to use against it. Such magic has a cost, but the poetic justice of using that power is too rich to resist.

As a Mythender, you understand that your true power to End gods comes from the willingness to sacrifice anything.

### Questions

**What unnaturalness do you wield?**

**What did you have to do to get your power?**

**What is the toll that must be paid?**

### Weapon Ideas

Gift listed in **Your Heart’s Gifts**.

## Loremaster

_who values the power of intellect and patience_

You are intellect and experience made manifest. There is no such thing as chance to you; when you walk onto the field of battle, you already know how it will end. And you will violently demonstrate that fact to all Myths. You are a philosopher, scholar, tactician, warrior-poet.

As a Mythender, you understand that your true power to End gods comes from confidence and sharpness of mind.

### Questions

**How do you use your mind on the field of battle?**

**How did you first use this against your foes?**

**What about the world do you wish to preserve?**

### Weapon Ideas

- My mind that has already won this battle (Intrinsic)

- The many devices I have forged to end Myth (Relic)
- My protégé, Punarinta (Companion)

### First Gift: Fast Strike

Might Cost: 1

The power you wield comes from the violence you inflict. Most Mythic Hearts must take the violence in, releasing its power later. You needn’t wait—you have learned how to channel your Heart more efficiently.

Gift listed in **Your Heart’s Gifts**.

## Making New Hearts

The point of the Heart is to give a focus on exactly how badass a Mythender with that Heart is. Because Mythender is so open-ended, this early decision is part of what keeps one Mythender feeling like another. So when you’re looking to make a new Heart, the first question to ask yourself is: what does this Heart do that others don’t? Just as important, what power is it that this Heart values?

Hearts ultimately answer the question of how a Mythender is going to stab gods in their fucking faces.

The difference can be small—such as creating a variant of the Commander called the Teacher, who values the power of wisdom and eagerness. It could be something that introduces new information into the setting—such as the Lycanthrope, who values the power of nature and duality. However, avoid those that sound more like backgrounds that describe where the Mythender came from—such as the Time Traveler. Those are Pasts. The Heart describes the person in the here and now.

The Heart’s three questions focus further, lending color and information to the story before you even answer them. The first one or two are usually obvious, but still need to be answered, as those are relatively easy answers to get a character concept started. For instance, answering the Commander’s “Who follows you into battle?” question makes you state how your character fulfills the base concept of being a Commander.

The third question spins the story in a different direction, though, either as hard or leading questions. The Tempest’s “What is the toll that must be paid?” tells you that there is a cost to the magic he wields. The Crusader’s “What is the inevitable result of your righteous deeds?” tells you that you do see an end, whether noble or ignoble, and aren’t thus filled with purpose. When the third question does this, it results in a deeper character.

Coming up with Weapon ideas will tell you if your Heart seems interesting from this game’s perspective. If you can come up with at least two right away, it has promise. If not, it probably isn’t the Heart for you. That said, don’t stress too much about this; in playing with the Heart, you’ll fill in the rest.

When choosing the first Gift for a Heart, pick whichever one seems thematically appropriate. It can be the same one that an existing Heart has; there’s no mandate that they all be different. Stick to ones that cost 2 Might tokens or fewer to use. You may even be tempted to create a new Gift for that Heart, though if you do, ask yourself this: why can’t other Mythenders have that Gift as well?

Finally, you could scrap all of the existing Hearts, and build new ones from scratch to fit a given theme. One fun theme could be to make Hearts based on the classic fantasy adventuring roles: the Fighter, the Cleric, the Rogue (or the Thief, if you’re old-school), the Wizard (or the Magic-User, if you’re way-old-school), the Paladin, the Bard, etc.

# Mythender Pasts

## Noble

_who knows the pressures of ruling and the expectations of a people_

You rule over others, by virtue of birth or conquest. You have never been granted peace, as the demands of your people have grown greater, their suffering more acute. Mortal efforts cannot silence their cries, and so Fate has given you the power beyond mortalkind. Whatever you wish for them, be it the end of war or blight, or a bright new age of conquest and glory, you will take it from the gods themselves.

### Questions

**What quality of your people do you most embody?**

**What did you promise your people?**

**What do you owe them?**

### Weapon Ideas

- The steadfastness of my people (Intrinsic)
- My guilt over letting my people down (Intrinsic)
- My regal crown and scepter (Relic)
- My personal guard (Companion)

### Bonds

`_______________` most reminds me of the plight of my people.

`_______________` shows me what true nobility is.

`_______________` reminds me of what I must rise above.

`_______________` shows me how my people could be stronger.

## Child

_who has suffered unimaginable cruelties and is forever hardened_

Your story is most tragic. After your innocence was sundered, you threw yourself into battle with all a child’s capacity for passion and abandon, but with no sense of wisdom or restraint. Fate has reached out to touch you with more than simple tragedy—you have seen the true, horrific cruelty that lies at the heart of man, of nature, of the Mythic World. Now, no one will ever hurt you again.

### Questions

**What cruelties have you endured?**

**What further fuels your limitless rage?**

## Mourner

_who has brought loss upon himself and bears a heavy cross_

You have lost someone dear, and that has crushed your very soul. You know you could have stopped it. But you weren’t strong enough, or fast enough, or brave enough, and now you are bereft and alone. Your Mythic Heart torments you constantly with the memory, aching with every beat. The only small hope left to you is that your newfound power can help make it so that no one else will know suffering as you have.

## Apostate

_who once served the Mythic world’s gods before seeing them for what they are_

You once served the gods and greater Myths (perhaps Norden’s own Odin, Thor, Loki, Freyja, Jörmungandr, Fenrir, or another). Raised to believe in these so-called gods, you worshiped without question. But your god pushed the bonds of your loyalty too far. You fled your life and became branded apostate. That is when you discovered the power to strike back, to teach the Mythic World the true meaning of justice…and vengeance.

### Questions

**What Myth did you devote yourself to, and what form did that devotion take?**

**What was done to make you flee your oaths and bonds?**

**What did you give that can never be replaced?**

## Exile

_who had been apart from mortals long before becoming a Mythender_

You were cast out of your mortal life long ago, and no one has since taken you in. You are a stranger to all, and living apart from others has shown you the truth of mankind’s tragic flaws. You took the power Fate offered you almost as if born to it, to reshape and perfect the world. You may not even remember your life before communing with your Mythic Heart, and it no longer matters. This is your destiny. This is your time.

### Questions

**Why were you cast out?**

**What skill has best served you in surviving all these years?**

**What about mortal nature is wrong?**

### Weapon Ideas

- Arcane talents bestowed by the naked earth (Intrinsic)

`_______________` understands my loneliness.

## Abomination

_who struggles with both his mortal and Mythic parentage_

You are the child of mortal and Myth, of a vile and questionable union. Your Mythic parent rejected you, and the mortal world could not contain you…but now, you have a third path, of power and revenge. The part of you born from Myth calls constantly, and because of that you fight with untold ferocity. With your last free breaths, you rally against the Mythic World and the callous hand its fickle gods have dealt you.

### Questions

**What Myth are you born from?**

**Why did your Mythic parent reject you?**

**What did you gain from your mortal parent?**

### Weapon Ideas

- Powers of deception from my father, Loki (Intrinsic)
- Dominion over lightning from my father, Thor (Intrinsic)
- Skill with mortal weapons, taught by my aunt (Intrinsic)
- The urge to forge a place for my kind (Intrinsic)

### Bonds

`_______________` sees my humanity.

`_______________` stands with me.

`_______________` keeps me humble.

`_______________` accepts all of me.

## Making New Pasts

First off, much of the advice on **Making New Hearts** applies in various ways to Pasts. However, Pasts ultimately answer the question of why a Mythender is going to stab gods in their fucking faces.

As with Hearts, the differences can be small or large. You might create a variant of the Abomination called the Once-Myth, who was once the Mythic World’s creation but became mortal. Or you might create something vast in scope that adds to your canon, such as the aforementioned Time Traveler, who fled from a future where the Mythenders failed.

When coming up with a Past, you can’t just say “So you’re a Time Traveler, now what?” Each Past has more focus than that. The Noble isn’t just a ruler, but a ruler who feels she owes something to her people. The Child isn’t just a kid, but one who had his childhood destroyed and can’t keep his anger in check. That’s where the Past’s questions come in—you need to create compelling questions that immediately focus the idea.

The first question should be obvious, in order to set a platform for the character concept. The Noble’s “What quality of your people do you most embody?” starts by assuming that the character is a noble with people, and jumps into asking you about those people. However, it does do without shifting the focus from the character. Asking “What quality is totally awesome about your people?” would often get the same answer, but doesn’t force you to write about your Mythender.

From there, dive into hard and interesting questions—which might stem right from that first one, or might be a separate part of the character concept that makes the Past more than just one-dimensional. The last question for the Child and Abomination both work to give a character depth, and not just be a ball of youthful rage or mini-Myth.

The advice for Weapon ideas is the same as with Hearts. As with Weapon ideas, you should have a couple strong ideas on the Past’s Bonds. If you’re altering an existing Past, look at those Bonds and consider how that alteration changes them, subtly or dramatically. If you don’t see any that change, then your Past isn’t different enough.

Finally, look at how your Pasts pair with the various Hearts. Combining the two is how players will begin to have richer character concepts. Looking at the main six Hearts and Pasts, here are some concepts found in history and media:

- <span class="keyword">Warrior + Noble</span>: Beowulf
- <span class="keyword">Crusader + Noble</span>: King Richard or Saint George
- <span class="keyword">Commander + Noble</span>: Leonidas
- <span class="keyword">Bearer + Noble</span>: King Arthur
- <span class="keyword">Crusader + Child</span>: Jeanne d’Arc (if you take “child” to mean “teenager”)
- <span class="keyword">Tempest + Exile</span>: Prospero from _The Tempest_
- <span class="keyword">Tempest + Abomination</span>: Gandalf
- <span class="keyword">Loremaster + Mourner</span>: Batman

These examples don’t all quite match up with the questions those Hearts and Pasts ask, and some people will argue that some of these ideas can fit with other combinations, but you can see how the Hearts and Pasts can inspire awesome Mythenders. More importantly, you can probably see cool character concepts that don’t fit with the current Hearts and Pasts.

## Making New Fates

Fates are vastly different from Hearts and Pasts, because they’re more esoteric. Because of that, they aren’t filled with questions to answer, but options to choose from and alter to taste. The easy way to make a new Fate is to change the Personal Blights and Forms on one of the Fate’s options. Many people do this—and that’s great!

If, on the other hand, you’re making a new Fate from scratch, you’ll need to know if you’re making a broad Fate or a narrow one. The six in this book are broad; you can tell this because there are two different takes for each one, which are only unified by the overall theme (reflected in the Heart’s Dream and its nebulous questions) and the Fate’s Power Over Mortals. A Fate with only one strong interpretation that you can see is a narrow Fate, though over time it may become broader.

Key to making a Fate is making sure it’s inhuman and at best only slightly sympathetic. The God of Blacksmiths, for instance, isn’t just some dude who likes to work all day over hot metal, but a deity that abhors freeloaders and those who do not contribute to civilization—those people erode his power. The God of Hedonism isn’t just someone who likes to party, but one who _needs_ mortals to engage in gluttony and debauchery, as that is his true food and drink.

When making a Fate, understand that the Fate’s Power Over Mortals exists for three reasons: to tell you what your Mythender can do that others can’t, to show you how your Mythender is pretty much already that god right now and should just give into Fate, and to give you and the Mythmaster ideas for Terrorizing Mortals for Power. Similarly, the Personal Blight exists as a tool for the Mythmaster to remind the Mythender at every turn that she’s not entirely mortal—_especially_ when she’s trying to Seek Sympathy and Healing.

The only advice I can give on making specific Personal Blights, Forms, and Power have already been said in **Damning Your Mythender**. Look at the Fates in this book as examples for tone. Keep the Forms about appearance, not about how mortals feel—that’s key to making a Personal Blight function in the story, as well as making Terrorizing Mortals the Mythender’s choice rather than an accident based on the current Form.

# Playing Adventures

## Adventuring to End Gods

<span class="mythender">Mythender</span> is about the quests to End the gods of the Mythic World. The Mythenders travel to distant points in the land that are important to gods—places where their most important followers live, or where sacred artifacts are buried, or rifts where the more alien parts of the Mythic World are.

This game is about playing out that quest: the smaller battles along the way that escalate as the Mythenders push forth, meeting the mortals that worship these gods and are horribly affected by your battles, and the climactic battle with the god. That’s what these rules cover.

> ##### Rhythm of an Adventure
>
> The Mythmaster and the Mythenders trade turns being in control of what happens in the adventure. The Mythmaster introduces battles with Myths, and the Mythenders have moments of humanity or Mythic power.
>
> ##### Structuring a Short Adventure
>
> A short adventure, lasting just one session, has a particular structure where the Mythmaster has two battles and the Mythenders get an opportunity between them to explore their mortal natures or push their Mythic Fates. An adventure always culminates into Ending a god.
>
> ##### Longer Adventures
>
> Longer adventures involve more turns for both the Mythenders’ and the Mythmaster. A campaign—multiple adventures linked together—can be just about Ending multiple gods, or can become personal as a Mythender Falls and his former comrades hunt him down.
>
> ##### Exploring the Mythic World
>
> Playing in a Mythic World hinges on describing that world as the Mythenders explore it.
>
> ##### When Mythenders Die & Fall
>
> When a Mythender dies or Falls, that’s a story opportunity for that player and the group as a whole. Use it!
>
> ##### In Between Adventures
>
> After an adventure is over, if you’re looking to play this Mythender again (either right away or bring her to another, future game), there are some things to think about.
>
> ##### Different Numbers of Mythenders
>
> The rules in this game are built for three or four Mythenders. If you’re playing with fewer, you’ll need to do some adjustments. If you absolutely must play with more, there’s an option for that as well (but again, it’s not nearly as fun).

### Play Time

Depending on how many players are at the table and how experiences everyone is, the time you need to play an adventure varies.

If you’re doing Mythender creation with new people, it can take up to an hour as people get their heads around some of the concepts. For experiences players, 15 to 30 minutes.

For a typical session (see **Structuring a Short Adventure**), it can take around three hours for a game with two or three Mythenders, and up to another hour if you have four. That assumes people new to the game and you’re playing the Tutorial battle. Naturally, an experienced group will cut through that faster.

That means it’s tight if you fit a game for four new players in a standard four-hour convention slot. It can be done, but the Mythmaster needs to put a lot of energy into keeping the game going and helping everyone quickly understand the game play.

### Old Mythenders on New Adventures

If you’re playing with a Mythender that has already adventures, you also need to reset your playsheet:

- Regardless of how much Might you ended with, you start with 5 Might tokens.
- All Weapon charge and drain boxes are unchecked.
- All Corruption and Fate boxes are unchecked, and the associated Gifts erased. The exception are those Corruption and Fate boxes marked as permanent, and those corresponding Gifts are kept.
- All Wound boxes are unchecked.

In addition, none of the lasting Blights from the previous adventure carry over.

If you’re playing an old Mythender, you may want to change your Weapons or Fate to reflect any ways your last adventure changed you.

## Rhythm of an Adventure

Mythender is broken into two different types of play, or “time.” On the Mythmaster’s time, he’ll start a battle, describing the set where it happens, and who shows up to fight. When the battle’s over and the aftermath is done, his time is over. Then the Mythenders have their time, when they can do things to the world around the mortals of the land, including changing it with a badass feat, terrorizing mortals for power, or seeking sympathy and healing.

### Mythmaster’s Time

A Mythmaster’s time is entirely about battling the Mythenders. You’ll present a challenge to them that they’ll have to overcome. Describe the arena of battle, and then launch right in. Note that the Myth always gets the first turn in the battle—the Mythic World doesn’t play fair (though it’s difficult for the Myth to have enough Lightning right away to Wound the Mythenders, so they have time to get into the action).

If, for some reason, the Mythenders don’t want to engage in the battle, that’s cool. They can all just choose to die instead. Once the challenge begins, fighting or dying are the only options.

Once the battle is over, it’s the Mythenders’ time.

#### Two Battles in a Row

Because Mythenders don’t reset their Weapon or Wound boxes until they have a moment to rest during their time, having two back-to-back battles makes for a rough game. On occasion, that’s exactly the right thing for the story, but everyone should understand what that means for the Mythenders.

Because there is no time to calm down, this also means any Blights in play remain active with their charges preserved from one battle to the next.

### Mythenders’ Time

This is when Mythenders can rest and interact with mortals. The Mythenders’ time always happens with mortals around and no immediate Myths to end. The things that Mythenders do during their time are known as <span class="keyword">Moments</span>—brief interludes where we see something about that Mythender.

At the start of this time, Mythenders clear any checked Wound boxes and their Weapon charge and drain boxes. This is because the Mythenders have a moment to rest, allowing their Mythic Hearts to finish healing their bodies. This also calms their battle rage.

Normally, each Mythender gets a chance to play out one Moment during their time: <span class="keyword">Perform a Badass, Epic Feat</span>; <span class="keyword">Terrorize Mortals for Power</span>; or <span class="keyword">Seek Sympathy and Healing</span>. If it makes sense for Mythenders to dwell longer during their time, that’s great! But time spent gives the Myths more time to gather their strength; give the next Myth some more Storm, starting Thunder, higher Wound cost, or Gifts. (That’s all up to the Mythmaster to use judgment.)

Once those moments are done, it’s time for the Mythmaster to start another battle.

#### Mythenders Challenging Gods to Battle

Sometimes a Mythender will call a god out or attempt to coax a god to battle. If they’re doing it in a way that’s also a Badass, Epic Feat, give that a chance to happen. When that feat’s done, or if they’re just shouting a challenge to the heavens, the Mythenders’ time is over. The players are asking for a battle to happen right now, so give them one!

That said, you don’t have to give then the fight with the god, if that doesn’t feel right for the game at that moment. Gods are happy to send envoys and armies in their name. Don’t feel you need to bring the climactic battle early just because a Mythender is mouthy about it.

### Murdering Another Mythender

**Murdering Another Mythender** always stops whatever’s going on, regardless of whose time it right now. After it’s resolved, the rest of the game resumes. It doesn’t take an action in battle or a Mythender’s moment to murder another one of your kind.

### The First Time in an Adventure

Usually, the Mythmaster starts the adventure off with a battle. That sets the tone for a game, and if this is anyone’s first time playing <span class="mythender">Mythender</span>, you need to do this.

You can change it up by having the first time belonging to the Mythenders, where they enter a mortal dwelling and have some moments to do things. This is a slow start for <span class="mythender">Mythender</span>, and it gives them a chance to gain resources for battle—Blights, Might, and more Gifts—so the following battle should be harder than you’d normally make the first one. Start with some Blights already created at the start of an adventure, and give the Myth some more Storm, starting Thunder, higher Wound cost, or Gifts. The gods in the **Mythic Norden** chapter like Odin or Fenrir are examples of harder gods.

Also, and this can’t be stressed enough: **use the tutorial battle for the first time you all play.**

### Starting Blights

The Mythmaster may start an adventure off with one or more pre-existing, lasting **Blights**. Only do this if everyone at the table is familiar with <span class="mythender">Mythender</span> and you’re starting off slow.

When this is the case it will either be introduced in the first battle (if it’s a catastrophe or similar) or when the Mythenders meet up with mortals (if it’s a curse or similar). This gives a sense of an immediate situation that isn’t just “we showed up to kill a god.” You instead get “we showed up to kill a god and also what the hell there’s a magic lava geyser destroying the land.”

If the game doesn’t start with a Blight, it should get one pretty quickly in the first battle. In these cases, sometimes it’s a Blight that’s caused because of something the Mythenders do in the battle. There’s nothing like saying in a battle’s aftermath “oh, that ice spell you used to freeze the trolls in place? Yeah, Norden corrupted that and now the specter of ice is spreading to animals and mortals.”

## Structuring a Short Adventure

A <span class="mythender">Mythender</span> adventure can take a little as four hours to play, if you stick to this structure:

### The Mythmaster Opens, Showing the World

Open with a grand description of the setting around the Mythenders. Where are they? What does it feel like? What’s on the horizon? Did anything just happen, or was this a long journey? Think of this like the opening scenes of a fantasy movie, while the credits are rolling.

### The Mythmaster asks questions

The Mythenders are powerful, independent agents! So find out about them. Ask the players questions to get a sense of detail and concrete feeling out of their characters, what’s going on in the world.

### The opening battle happens!

The first battle of the adventure happens pretty early on, as the first substantial scene, as the Mythenders are on their way to end a god. If you have players who haven’t played Mythender before, use the Tutorial Battle chapter. If everyone’s played before and remembers how, get crazy with a full battle!

### Mythenders meet the people of this land

After the battle is over and we see the aftermath, the Mythenders meet the people of this land. Will they try to seek sympathy from mortals in order to keep their souls? Will they terrorize mortals for power? What they do now means as much as what they do in battle.

### They fight the final battle against a god!

The god the Mythenders have promised to kill meets them on the field of battle. Now the Mythenders prove worthy of their title!

### The world changes & the Mythenders move on

The Mythmaster and players work together to show how the world has changed, for worse and better, by the actions of their Mythenders. When that battle is over, the Mythenders discover their fate: to die, to become a god, or to continue this existence and fight another day. Those that live move on, for there are more gods in this world to End.

#### A Note on Character Creation

If you plan on character creation as part of this session, know that it sometimes takes an hour or so to get characters ready for play. Budget for this time accordingly, use the quick or popular culture method in **Creating Your Mythender**, or bring some pre-generated characters. There are quite a few up on [MythenderRPG.com](http://mythenderrpg.com). If you have more time, either more hours in an evening or want to play an adventure over two or three sessions, that’s easy to do!

#### Example Adventure

There is an example adventure with this structure in the Mythic Norden chapter: **Thorberge**. It expects you to use the Tutorial battle rules.

## Longer Adventures

### Adding More Time

You can add more to your game by adding in some more battle scenes and time in between those scenes. You keep the pace hopping in between battles by having the next fight come to the Mythenders.

Stick to ending one god per adventure. They don’t congregate, not when there are Mythenders roaming the land looking to end them.

### Playing Multiple Adventures: the Campaign

Having one adventure is fun, and maybe you want to keep going. The same characters can keep going on adventures if you all want (and, of course, if they survive).

Did one of the characters become a Myth? Great! You know your next target. Maybe that player could even take a turn Mythmastering, playing the Myth he became.

### Replacing Mythenders that Fall or Die

In a long-running game, you’ll have some characters either fall and become Myths or die as mortals. When that happens, the next character that player plays should be influenced by the former character’s actions. Did your old Mythender inspire someone along the way? Did you sire children who will take up your mantle, whether you died nobly or became corrupt and twisted?

There’s more on this in **When Mythenders Die & Fall** and **In Between Adventures**.

## Exploring the Mythic World

When a moment or a battle takes place in a new location, you’re exploring more of the Mythic World. The Mythmaster describes what it looks like and what’s going on as the Mythenders enter, and the players may ask questions to clarify what’s described so they understand it and can see it in their minds.

Think of each new place, starting with the very first scene in the game when you’re describing the Mythenders arriving to some interesting place or where a battle is about to begin, as a set in a movie or a two-page spread in a comic book.

The Mythic Norden chapter has a bit on **Some Cities & Towns** and **Some Battle Sets**. These should help you get started with ideas for games in Mythic Norden and give you some ideas for games in other Mythic Worlds.

### Questions for your Description

Great description comes from answering questions the other people didn’t realize they were asking. Here are some questions your descriptions of the world could answer. But don’t treat this as a checklist! This list is, by nature, incomplete and not everything is relevant to every moment.

Don’t try to answer every question every time. But think about some of these when you describe the world. And note down your own questions if you think of any! More tools for your Mythmaster toolbox.

#### Sky

What time of day is it? Where is the sun or moon, if it can be seen at all? Stars? Birds? Creatures? Rolling clouds with thunder? A tornado nearby?

#### Distance

How far away can you see before the terrain or fog or curve of the earth interfere? Are they in a dense forest, where there isn’t much beyond trees? Can they see to the horizon? Is there a mountain or something else massive in their view?

#### Terrain

Is there a lot of room here, or is it cramped? Plains of snow or in a dense forest? Is the land flat and easy to cross or is it broken? Rocks? Crags? Impassible terrain? Is there anything inhospitable here, like lava gushing up or lightning continually striking down?

#### Water

Where is the sea? Nowhere to be found, or nearby? Can you hear it? Smell it? What about a river or lake?

#### Weather

What does the air feel like? The ground? The heat or cold? Rain and Snow? Thunder? Or clear skies?

#### Colors & Sounds

What colors do the Mythenders see? What sounds do they hear?

#### Myths

What’s around that is a foe to Mythenders? Spirits? Creatures? Envoys of the gods? The gods themselves? Are there any Blights oppressing the land?

#### Mortals

Who is there to observe? Where do they live? Farmlands, huts and houses, castles?

#### Blights

Is there a Blight here? What does it look and feel like? Tell the players that it’s a Blight—Mythenders can tell the difference between some random event and a Blight.

### Involve Personal Blights

Do any of the Mythenders have personal blights that are pushing against the Mythic World, causing it to change? A bright, sunny day can grow dark if a Mythender has a personal blight that dims the sun in his presence.

### Revisiting Locations

If you revisit a location, describe it by focusing on what has changed because of the Mythender’s actions or the Myth’s rage. Mythenders can’t help but wreak change in their wake, so if even they didn’t intend to, something has always shifted by the time they return to a place.

## When Mythenders Die & Fall

Mythenders may die in battle or at the hands of another Mythender, or they may fall and submit to their dark apotheosis. Either way, when that happens, that Mythender’s story is over.

When this happen, that’s an opportunity to introduce something new to the overall story.

### Dynastic Mythender Creation

If your Mythender dies, you have a number of options for a new Mythender that has a connection to your old one:

- A former Companion could inherit your mantle, and become a Mythender on his own
- A mortal you bonded with could take Mythic inspiration from you
- A mortal witness to your acts, one you didn’t notice, could take it upon herself to finish what you started
- A brother, sister, son, daughter, or old friend turned Mythender could arrive to be at your side as you die—that sort of timing is common in the Mythic World

If your Mythender falls into Myth, you have a couple more options that make your new character directly tied to the Myth you became:

- An abomination child that you bore or sired, either before or after you fell
- A mortal you bonded with that seeks revenge for your betrayal, or seeks to end your suffering and release you from your Mythic burden
- A former Companion that was able to turn away from the overwhelming Mythic Power and become a Mythender, even while the rest of those Companions were absorbed into Myth

If you do this, you’re making a character that has ties to the Mythic Power of the last one. You
may, if you choose, check off your first Fate box and have that Gift slot open.

### Dying Mid-Adventure

If you all die mid-adventure, the game’s over (though you might start a new adventure following in those footsteps). But if only some of you don’t make it–either choosing to die in battle or getting murdered by your fellows–take a moment to allow those without living Mythenders to make new characters.

This shouldn’t take long; if they made their last characters, then they have enough experience to make new ones. If they used pre-generated characters, then at least they have an idea of how the game works now and have more direct inspiration to draw from.

Describe how these new Mythenders come into play. Are they mortals nearby who suddenly have Mythic Hearts? Are they Mythenders from far away who have just arrived in time? Nothing is unheard of in the land of Myth.

_Note on Blights_: if you die, any Blights you made continue after your death.

### Falling & the Next Adventure

A fallen Mythender is an opportunity to have a new adventure where you’re hunting down that Myth. If that player would like a chance at being a Mythmaster, all the better!

## In Between Adventures

For Mythenders that survive Ending a god and not dying or falling, this is a good time to take a hard look at your character, and make changes for next time.

### Changing Weapons

Did your Mythender decide to put down old Weapons and take up new ones? The god you Ended has plenty of awesome stuff to take, or maybe you encountered something that changed how you see your battle with the Mythic World.

It’s totally cool to take Thor’s hammer and replace a Weapon with it, claiming the poetic justice of Ending Myths with this icon of Mythhood. Or take on its Companions as your own, enslaving Mythic beings for your purpose.

(You can also choose to change a Weapon during an adventure, if you narrate an interesting an appropriate moment. If you do, erase any checks in Charge Boxes that haven’t been drained, and leave those that are drained checked—this isn’t a way to cheat into a benefit.)

### Changing Fate

Fates can change as a Mythender journeys on. Did something happen that shifted you? Did your Mythic Heart discovered—or create—some new temptation? Perhaps it’s adapting your Fate to a god you’re willing to embrace.

Feel free to change your Personal Blight, your Forms, and even your Fate’s Power to something that’s more in line with the sort of god you think your Mythender is destined to horrifically transform into.

### Changing Bonds

In between adventures is a good time to look at your Bonds with those comrades who survives with you and any new Mythenders you’ve met. Feel free to revise them to be about why you value that person now. After all, relationships change over time.

### Retiring a Mythender

Mythenders don’t retire peacefully, don’t get a second change at mortal life, but that doesn’t mean you have to keep playing her! If you want your Mythender to go off into the sunset, slaughtering Myths on her own, awesome! You could make a new Mythender, using the ideas on the previous page.

## Different Numbers of Mythenders

As written, <span class="mythender">Mythender</span> is set up for three or four players, plus the Mythmaster. You can play with different numbers, though you’ll need to change a few things.

### Two Mythenders

If you have two players, reduce the final god’s Storm and starting Thunder dice by 2, and the starting Might by 4.

### One Mythender

In addition to changing the god’s attributes as above, reduce every Myth’s Wound cost by one. Also, delay each Gathering Rage power by one round. So the power that happens after round one will happen after round two, etc. Nothing happens after round one. The Mythender fails after round six, not round five.

In this situation, the <span class="keyword">Swiftness</span> Gift is not available to the Myth. And the additional cost for the Mythender using it right after his original turn is waived.

#### Mythenders Who Die

These rules are only to be used when you start an adventure with fewer Mythenders. If you start with more Mythenders and some die in battle and don’t make new Mythenders, don’t change anything.

### More than Four Mythenders

While I don’t recommend playing with more than four Mythenders, if you do, the Myth gets a free second action during the round, after the first three Mythenders in that round go. This action cannot be preempted by the Swiftness Gift.

But, seriously: don’t actually play with more than four Mythenders. While the numbers can all be tweaked in attempt to make the game functional, the core problem that Mythender has once you go beyond four Mythenders and a Mythmaster is that there’s so much time between turns in battle that the game doesn’t feel as high-octane. And that much Mythic Power being slung around starts to make the individual Mythenders seem not as special or iconic as they should be.

# Tutorial Battle

## How & When to Use this Tutorial

This tutorial battle will teach you how all of the pieces and parts work in <span class="mythender">Mythender</span>:

- Charging and draining Weapons and Blights
- Creating, using, and destroying Blights
- Wounding your foes
- Gathering power and Corruption

Anytime you have even one player who has never played <span class="mythender">Mythender</span>, use this tutorial for the first battle. Start off your Mythmaster turn as this battle.

### Assumptions

You all should have a Mythender playsheet in front of you (or in the case of the Mythmaster, a Myth playsheet) as well as some Blight cards. <span class="mythender">Mythender</span> is nearly impossible to play without them (though making a Myth playsheet and Blight cards on the fly isn’t too difficult).

The Mythmaster will direct everyone through this tutorial. It will be very helpful if everyone has a copy of this chapter, but that’s not strictly necessary. Ideally, the Mythmaster has read the actual Battle chapter and, well, the rest of the book.

### Physical Tokens

You’re using physical tokens for everything, right? A bunch of Storm dice (![white dice](/catalog/creators/ryan-macklin/mythender/storm-6.svg)), Thunder dice (![black dice](/catalog/creators/ryan-macklin/mythender/thunder-6.svg)), and bonus Thunder dice (![red dice](/catalog/creators/ryan-macklin/mythender/bonus-6.svg)) within reach of everyone? And at least one Mythic die (![giant die](/catalog/creators/ryan-macklin/mythender/mythic-6.svg)) on hand? Two kinds of tokens for Lightning and Might?

Mythender battles are tactile experiences. Not using them makes the baby Odin smile with joy, and we certainly don’t want that, do we?

### Using this Tutorial

The text is addressed to the Mythmaster, so when you see “you,” that’s who we’re talking to. Of course, everyone is more than welcome to read and follow along. The text just assumes as a base idea that the Mythmaster is reading and the players are following verbal directions.

This is split up to distribute the rules in easy-to-learn chunks, starting with the foundations and moving up.

#### When to Do Something

<p class="do-this"><span class="keyword">Everyone</span>: when the font looks like this, the Mythmaster or a player is directed to do
something. Okay, except for this time. This is just an example.</p>

#### When to Read Verbatim

<p class="read-aloud">When the font looks like this, read it as-is to the players. Each section will be flagged to read, demonstrated below.</p>

<p class="read-aloud">If something is in [Brackets], it means fill that part in with the appropriate bit.</p>

Other text can be paraphrased. The point of the verbatim text is to also convey a larger than life tone while being a little tongue-in-cheek. If that’s not your style, change the text to suit. But if you do, **tell the same information and convey the same sense of grandeur and challenge in your tone**.

#### Going Off-Script

This chapter is written to help those who are comfortable reading from a book and haven’t spent a lot of time learning this game. Some people really hate reading from a book, and if you’re one of those people, please try it anyway for the sake of learning and teaching the group. This game has a complex economy and it helps to introduce rules in chunks.

### Special Rules for the Tutorial

<p class="do-this"><span class="keyword">Mythmaster</span>: read the following to the table.</p>

<p class="read-aloud">Because this tutorial is designed to introduce concepts in layers, we’re going to ignore some of the rules during different parts of it. If a rule hasn’t been mentioned yet, then it’s not applicable right now. After this battle, all rules are fair game.</p>

<p class="read-aloud">Sometimes I’ll cheat, in order to make the tutorial work with fickle dice. I’ll point that out every time I do so.</p>

<p class="read-aloud">It’s cool to ask questions about what’s going on and what’s on the playsheet. But I might respond with “We’ll get to that in a bit” if the rule’s about to be covered later.</p>

<p class="do-this"><span class="keyword">Mythmaster</span>: when the players ask a question that’s not covered in the current step, let
them know that you’ll get to it later.</p>

### What the Mythmaster Need to Keep in Mind

Your biggest job involves keeping tone and scale consistent. This is why you Push Forward on most of the early actions in battle: you set the tone for what should be narrated and what is and isn’t right for a given scale of action.

### What Rules Aren’t Covered in this Tutorial

Most of the rules are covered in this tutorial, but not all of them. There are prelude actions, which is a way for one Mythender to go before the Myth in battle. Doubling down on a Wound can be resisted, though it costs your foe Lightning tokens to do so. And there are many Gifts that manipulate how battle works for you. Also, Murder isn’t covered by this tutorial, as that’s a major distraction to learning how battle works.

At this point, you have enough experience with battle to pick up on the various tricks and rules as you read through the Battle chapter and the list of Gifts.

### The Bare Minimum Knowledge

Ideally, the Mythmaster has taken some time to digest this book, but we don’t live in an ideal world. If you’re trying to get a jump into playing Mythender sooner, at least skim the **What is Mythender?**, **What You Need to Play**, and **Creating Your Mythender** chapters so you have a sense of the game’s scope, as well as the **Battling Myths & Gods** chapter—especially **What to Think About During a Battle**, **Really Important Concepts**, **Physical & Metaphysical Nature of Battle**, and **The Shape of Foes**. The tutorial might be rocky with just a skim, but at least you can try it. And after you do, you and the rest of the group will have actual play context to draw from while reading this book.

## Tutorial Battle Overview

##### Setup

Where everyone will gather dice and tokens for the start of the battle.

##### Myth’s First Action

The Myth starts off each battle. The Mythmaster will show charging a Weapon and overall flow of an action.

##### Mythenders’ First Actions

The Mythenders take Legendary actions to start with, and will charge a Weapon and practice the overall flow of action. The Mythmaster will Push Forward.

##### Myth’s Second Action

The Myth will charge a Weapon again, and also create a Blight.

##### Mythenders’ Second Actions

The Mythenders take Mythic actions this time, charging a Weapon and using the Mythic die. They’ll also create and charge Blights.

##### Suffering Corruption

When Mythenders use the Mythic die, they suffer Corruption.

##### Myth’s Third Action

The Myth will drain the Weapon and Wound the Mythenders.

##### Wounding the Mythenders

This describes what happens when Mythenders are Wounded.

##### Dead Mythenders

Should a Mythender run out of Thunder dice due to being Wounded, this covers what happens, and how a Mythender comes back from death.

##### The Mythenders’ Third Round

The third round is a bit more complicated in this tutorial, as the Mythmaster needs to introduce new rules in a sequence: Draining, Titanic actions, and Wounding.

##### Mythenders’ Third Action: Mythic/Draining

Some Mythenders will do another Mythic action, and also possibly drain the Blight they’ve been charging.

##### Mythenders’ Third Action: Titanic

Some Mythenders will do a Titanic action, generating much more Lightning at the cost of inflicting self-harm.

##### Wounding the Myth

This describes what happens when Myth is Wounded.

##### Battle Epilogue

The battle is over! Time for the epilogue.

## Advice From Others on the Tutorial

Many other people have run the tutorial. Here’s some advice

“It’s really easy to go off-script when running the tutorial battle. Of the two times I’ve ran it, it definitely went smoother when I stuck closer to the script. There’s so many moving pieces, if you don’t follow the script it’s easy to get lost. So, I’d say that even though it can feel a little forced to follow the script exactly, do so. It makes a difference.” —Jeremiah Frye

“If the players are unused to the notion of narrative control and are instead accustomed to rolling to see if they succeed, remind them they _will_ succeed, and the die roll just helps describe _how_ well. ‘Do, or do not; there is no try.’

“Remind them there is no defense. There is no escape. The only way to succeed is to act before they are killed.

“If the players get comfortable with the notion of extreme physical violence, remind them that Myth is also metaphysical. The Mythenders each have an emotional basis for their origins. You can demonstrated this by having the Myth strikes them at that very emotional core.” —Robert Calfee

“Go big or go extinct. You need to get the players to hammer home with creative, epic ideas. It’s a one-shot, so you really don’t need to show any care or restraint in terms of escalation. Feel free to let it get ridiculous, and encourage each stunt to top previous stunts. The first time I ever played Mythender, one of the Mythenders used a dark and brooding presence to start pulling the Moon down to Norden. We then used that Moon to smash a hole all the way through the center of the world, and then had a fight in that tunnel. Thor wound up smashed between the walls of the world-hole.

“Describe the battlefield in its ongoing state. The Mythenders, even if they’re not creating Blights, are still affecting the landscape. Remind them of the details of the battlefield, and help them draw a vivid picture of what’s going on and where. If they’re looking for ideas, toss in suggestions such as ‘Well, half of the mountain’s lying at your feet in big, granite-y chunks; maybe you could do something with that?’” —Andy Hauge

“I don’t have poker chips handy, but I do have a change dish. What I did when I ran the tutorial battle was use pennies for Lightning tokens and quarters for Might tokens. (I also used nickels as 5× Lightning tokens when I ran low on pennies.) The game is definitely a tactile experience. I felt the small nature of pennies contrasted well with the relatively heavy quarters. I’d suggest having a physical texture or weight difference between the Lightning tokens and Might tokens to emphasize how weighty Might is—opposed to simply red poker chips for one and blue chips for the other, where you can’t feel the difference. When you spend Might, you’re doing something no mortal could ever accomplish. It may help new players grasp that if their game tokens convey that same feeling.

“Also, this shouldn’t really need to be said, but you should not let the Mythenders Murder each other during the tutorial. It sounds so obvious but it might be worth foot noting as a ‘don’t be a dick,’ at least not during the tutorial. New players probably won’t even know it’s possible, but you know, just in case.” —Michael Gray Thompson

## Setup

For this tutorial, you’ll need a Myth playsheet for the einherjar (**Einherjar, the Honored Dead**).

### The First Thing in the Adventure

This tutorial assumes that the Mythmaster is starting in the adventure with this battle, and that the Mythenders have not had any other moments yet. If you deviate from this, all of the numbers will be off, due to the Mythenders possibly having gained Corruption and Fate.

### Gathering Dice & Tokens

Each Mythender should gather 3 Storm dice (![white dice](/catalog/creators/ryan-macklin/mythender/storm-6.svg)) and put them in the top-left corner of their playsheets, the one labeled <span class="keyword">Storm Dice</span>. Then they gather 1 Thunder die (![black die](/catalog/creators/ryan-macklin/mythender/thunder-6.svg)) and put it in the bottom-left corner of their playsheets, labeled <span class="keyword">Thunder Dice</span>. They leave the bottom-right corner, <span class="keyword">Lightning Tokens</span>, empty. Finally, they each should have 5 Might tokens in the top-right corner, labeled <span class="keyword">Might Tokens</span>.

If any of them has the <span class="keyword">Harbinger of Storm</span> Gift, they take 5 Storm dice instead of 3.

<p class="do-this"><span class="keyword">Mythmaster</span>: if any of the Mythenders has the “Harbinger of Storm” gift, read the following to the table.</p>

<p class="read-aloud">You probably notice that some of you have a Storm Rating of 3, and others a Storm Rating of 5. This is because of your Gifts. We won’t get into this in any detail right away, but Gifts change some of the battle rules for your Mythender. The “Harbinger of Storm” Gift gives you two more Storm. The other ones you have let you do different things, by spending those Might tokens you have.</p>

<p class="read-aloud">I’ll explain what those other Gifts do later. For now, we’ll focus on the basic rules. But know that Gifts are key to bringing the Myth down. The Myth also has some Gifts, which I won’t use right away.</p>

<p class="do-this"><span class="keyword">Mythmaster</span>: if no one has the “Harbinger of Storm” gift, read the following to the table.</p>

<p class="read-aloud">You’ll see a couple things called Gifts and Might on your playsheet. They’re your special ways of changing how the battle rules work for you. We’ll get into how they work later. But know that they’re key to bringing the Myth down. The Myth also has some Gifts, which I won’t use right away.</p>

Then gather the 4 Storm dice, 2 Thunder dice, and 6 Might tokens that the einherjar have for yourself.

### Set the Scene

This battle uses the snow-covered plains set (**Some Battle Sets**) from the Norden chapter, tweaked to fit the Thorberge adventure (**Thorberge: a Norden Adventure**).

#### Snow-covered plains

**_Fresh snow has fallen at the base of this mountain. Up in the distance: trees and rocky outcropping. Beyond that lies the Fort of Thorberge, a place where Thor’s warrior cult trains for eternal battle. But that is a great distance away. Above you, storm clouds crackle. Thor certainly watches overhead._**

These sets are just some color to frame the battle. Describe it as-is or with your own words. Then add how the Mythenders arrive: walking for several days, on their way to a fortress high atop a mountain where Thor has a warrior cult. (Or something else, if the god you’ll have them End is different.)

Then the einherjar enter, some three hundred of them, waiting for the Mythenders to approach. As they do, have the einherjar call out to the Mythenders, demanding they turn back to face another god, such as Loki. These Myths are ready to battle, but have the good sense to know what fate awaits them when they do.

The Mythenders may charge right away, or may exchange a few words before the battle.

<p class="do-this"><span class="keyword">Mythmaster</span>: if a Mythender describe launching into the battle, read the following, then start the battle.</p>

<p class="read-aloud">In this game, the Myths always get the first turn. But that’s a great action, so hold onto it for the moment, and use that when it’s your turn.</p>

Of course, if it’s not a great action, well, I guess lie. Don’t dampen the mood right now; you’ll get a chance to explain how actions work in a bit.

<p class="do-this"><span class="keyword">Mythmaster</span>: otherwise, launch into battle.</p>

Either way, when the battle starts, go to the next page, **Myth’s First Action**.

## Myth’s First Action

<p class="do-this"><span class="keyword">Mythmaster</span>: read the following to the table.</p>

<p class="read-aloud">I’m going to show you how a basic action works. I’ll start by choosing a Weapon. Then I’ll describe being totally awesome with it by attacking some or all of you. I’ll check off a Weapon charge box, roll some dice, get some stuff, and then describe what happens as a result of my action.</p>

<p class="read-aloud">Don’t worry, I can’t Wound you guys with this first attack. The thing I’m reading just told me I couldn’t. That will come later. Right now, we’re going to see how attacking generates power for me to use in later turns.</p>

### Form Your Action

<p class="do-this"><span class="keyword">Mythmaster</span>: choose your Relic Weapon, and tell the table what you’re using.</p>

If you’re using the einherjar, you should have <span class="keyword">Arms forged by the dwarves and gods</span> as a Relic Weapon. If not, choose whatever Relic or Companion Weapon you have on your Myth playsheet.

You’re intentionally not using an Intrinsic or Companion Weapon because that makes this tutorial run smoother. The Intrinsic Weapon’s starting charge would mean that your second
and third turns won’t look like this tutorial assumes.

The Weapon you’ll choose will be used throughout this tutorial, to show how charging and draining a Weapon works. You won’t have that restriction in normal battles.

### Describe Being Awesome

<p class="do-this"><span class="keyword">Mythmaster</span>: describe your action. Make sure your Weapon is important in that action.</p>

If you’re using the defaults from the setup, the opening battle with the einherjar from the Thorberge adventure (**Thorberge: a Norden Adventure**), describe the einherjar charging in with axes and hurling spears into the air. Make the description dramatic and high-action, but stop before you describe doing anything to the Mythenders.

If you’re using a different setup, you’re on your own to describe the action.

Either way, refer to **Describe Being Awesome** on making your action work if you need some help.

### Charge Your Weapon

<p class="do-this"><span class="keyword">Mythmaster</span>: check the first charge box on that Weapon, the one in the +3 Dice column. Then read the following.</p>

                                                       +3 Dice  +2 Dice  +2 Might
    Arms forged by the dwarves and gods …is my weapon    ☒☐       ☐☐       ☐☐
      ☐ Intrinsic     ☒ Relic    ☐ Companion

<p class="read-aloud">During this action, I’m charging a Weapon. That means I’m putting a check in one of the top “charge boxes”—in this case, the +3 Dice box. This doesn’t give me a bonus right now, but later, when I drain it, I’ll get the bonus. You’ll see that on my third turn.</p>

### Roll Dice & Gain Power

<p class="do-this"><span class="keyword">Mythmaster</span>: read the following to the table.</p>

<p class="read-aloud">Now I’m going to gather up my dice. These guys have a Storm rating of 4, so I’m grabbing 4 Storm dice—the white ones. They also start with 2 Thunder dice, because that’s what it says on their Myth sheet, so I’m grabbing my 2 black dice. Now I’ll roll them and see what happens!</p>

<p class="do-this"><span class="keyword">Mythmaster</span>: gather your white Storm dice and black Thunder dice. Roll them together.</p>

For each Thunder die that comes up ![4](/catalog/creators/ryan-macklin/mythender/thunder-4.svg), ![5](/catalog/creators/ryan-macklin/mythender/thunder-5.svg), or ![6](/catalog/creators/ryan-macklin/mythender/thunder-6.svg), gain a Lightning token. Put this into the Lightning pool on your playsheet.

For each Storm die that comes up ![4](/catalog/creators/ryan-macklin/mythender/storm-4.svg), ![5](/catalog/creators/ryan-macklin/mythender/storm-5.svg), or ![ 6](/catalog/creators/ryan-macklin/mythender/storm-6.svg), gain a Thunder die. Put this in the Thunder pool on your playsheet. You’ll use it in future turns.

If either your Storm or your Thunder rolled all failures, change one to a ![storm 4](/catalog/creators/ryan-macklin/mythender/storm-4.svg). Explain that you’re cheating, because it’s a tutorial, and normally you can’t just do that.

<p class="do-this"><span class="keyword">Mythmaster</span>: read the following to the table.</p>

<p class="read-aloud">See how I got some Thunder dice and Lightning tokens? Successes—4s, 5s, and 6s—cause that. Lightning is how you get things done, like Wound somebody or create a Blight, things we’ll do in later turns. Thunder is how you generate more Lightning, but it’s also how you stay alive when some Myth tries to kill you…which we’ll get to as soon as the rules let me.</p>

When you’re delivering lines like “as soon as the rules let me Wound you,” try to do so with a sense of devilish playfulness. Don’t come off like you’re a jerk.

### Push Forward

<p class="do-this"><span class="keyword">Mythmaster</span>: describe what happens in that action’s aftermath.</p>

If you’re using the default, describe how the spears and axes bite into the Mythenders, enough to cause flesh wounds and maybe make them take a step back. If you’re using another setup, you’re on your own for describing that. Either way, look to **Push Forward** for guidance on pushing forward.

Sell that the Mythenders are powerful beings, though, and simple weapons like this are not enough to make them sweat. At least, not yet. If any of the Mythenders have a Companion Weapon that counts as a horde (see **The Shape of Foes**), kill a few nameless ones.

<p class="do-this"><span class="keyword">Mythmaster</span>: your turn is over. Proceed to the Mythenders’ turns.</p>

## Mythenders’ First Actions

### Choosing Who Goes

<p class="do-this"><span class="keyword">Mythmaster</span>: read the following to the table when the Mythenders’ actions start.</p>

<p class="read-aloud">When you guys get to act, you get to choose the order you all go. If one of you is ready to go, awesome. Otherwise, the player to my left will start.</p>

<p class="read-aloud">Note that in a normal battle, if you cannot decide who’s turn it is because of arguing or indecision, and you bicker about it, your turns are all over and the next round begins. But don’t worry; I totally trust that you will be awesome and ready for action.</p>

Here’s where you’ll want the players to get comfortable with choosing their own initiative in battle. If there’s indecision, pick a player to go, but give them a chance to talk it out first.

### Form Your Action

<p class="do-this"><span class="keyword">Mythmaster</span>: read the following to the table the first time a Mythender acts this round. If someone needs this reread on their action, reread it.</p>

<p class="read-aloud">Now you’ll do what I did: start by choosing a Weapon, then describe being totally awesome with it by attacking me, check off a Weapon charge box, roll some dice, and get some stuff. I’ll describe what happens as a result. And just like I couldn’t wound you on my turn, you won’t wound me on this one. Again, don’t worry—you’ll soon get a chance to slaughter my Myth!</p>

<p class="read-aloud">Unlike my turns, you Mythender have another thing to decide on yours, called “scale.” For this turn, you’ll do a Legendary action, which means you’ll describe being super-strong, able to conjure magic, things like that. Don’t worry too much about what that means right now; it’s my job as the Mythmaster to moderate scale.</p>

<p class="do-this"><span class="keyword">Player</span>: choose a Weapon. For tutorial purposes, you’ll use the same Weapon through the battle.</p>

Ideally, the players should all choose different kinds of Weapons; one picking an Intrinsic, one a Relic, and one a Companion. After the first Mythender goes, ask follow-up ones to choose a different kind, but don’t force the issue.

If there’s indecision, help them out by asking which one they’re most excited about. That’s more important right now than which type they use. Also point out, if needed, that they can solicit help from the table. However, the choice is always in their hands.

<p class="do-this"><span class="keyword">Mythmaster</span>: if you offer a suggestion that the player doesn’t like or isn’t inspired by, bow to them or take a knee and apologize, saying “I’m sorry Lord/Lady Mythender for my presumption. Please don’t kill me.” This is a standing rule.</p>

### Describe Being Awesome

<p class="do-this"><span class="keyword">Player</span>: describe your action. Make sure your Weapon is important in that action.</p>

You may need to help guide this description. Make sure it keeps to a Legendary action scale (see **Scales of Action**). Make sure that the action doesn’t begin describing the aftermath, though if you’re using a Myth that counts as a horde (and you should be), point out that it’s totally cool to describe slaughtering a score of them right now—since that doesn’t significantly diminish their numbers, it doesn’t count as Wounding.

### Charge Your Weapon

<p class="do-this"><span class="keyword">Player</span>: check the first charge box on that Weapon, the one in the +3 Dice column.</p>

                                     +3 Dice  +2 Dice  +2 Might
    A totally badass example           ☒☐       ☐☐       ☐☐
      ☐ Intrinsic     ☒ Relic    ☐ Companion

### Roll Dice & Gain Power

<p class="do-this"><span class="keyword">Player</span>: gather your Storm dice and your 1 Thunder die. Roll them together.</p>

If your Thunder die comes up ![4](/catalog/creators/ryan-macklin/mythender/thunder-4.svg), ![5](/catalog/creators/ryan-macklin/mythender/thunder-5.svg), or ![6](/catalog/creators/ryan-macklin/mythender/thunder-6.svg), gain a Lightning token. Put this into the Lightning pool on your playsheet.

For each Storm die that comes up ![4](/catalog/creators/ryan-macklin/mythender/storm-4.svg), ![5](/catalog/creators/ryan-macklin/mythender/storm-5.svg), or ![6](/catalog/creators/ryan-macklin/mythender/storm-6.svg), gain a Thunder die. Put this in the Thunder pool on your playsheet. You’ll use it in future turns.

### If You Gained Nothing

<p class="do-this"><span class="keyword">Mythmaster</span>: if the player gained no Thunder or Lightning this turn, explain and use the following rule.</p>

When this happens, it means the action succeeded, as all actions do, but the Mythic World is resisting the flow of power. The Mythender can break through this resistance by spending 1 Might token, and then reroll the dice. If that reroll also generates nothing, the player may claim either a Thunder die or Lightning token.

_Note_: this rule only exists for when nothing is gained.

### Push Forward

<p class="do-this"><span class="keyword">Mythmaster</span>: explain that normally you’ll describe what happens as a result, and then describe what happens.</p>

When you’re describing, make sure you’re selling that the Mythender is an awesome, terrible force of destruction. They did something this turn to get power. Use the guidance on **Push Forward**.

<p class="do-this"><span class="keyword">Player</span>: your turn is over. Proceed to the next Mythender’s turn, or to the next round if everyone has had a turn.</p>

## Myth’s Second Action

<p class="do-this"><span class="keyword">Mythmaster</span>: read the following to the table.</p>

<p class="read-aloud">My second turn will look a lot like my first one: I’ll pick a Weapon, describe the action, and describe the aftermath. I’ll use the same Weapon as I did before, charging the next box.</p>

<p class="read-aloud">What’s different is that I’ll end this turn by creating a Blight—a scar on the land or other calamity that I can draw power from later. You’ll see what I mean soon.</p>

### Claim Might

<p class="do-this"><span class="keyword">Mythmaster</span>: claim 2 Might tokens and read the following.</p>

<p class="read-aloud">On every turn after the first, the Myth gets more Might tokens. This Myth gets 2 more each turn. Other, nastier Myths will get more, along with having more wicked stats.</p>

### Form Your Action

<p class="do-this"><span class="keyword">Mythmaster</span>: choose the same Weapon as you did last time.</p>

### Describe Being Awesome

<p class="do-this"><span class="keyword">Mythmaster</span>: describe your action. Make sure your Weapon is important in that action.</p>

As with the first time, describe your action with this Weapon. At this point, the Mythenders will have done quite a bit in the battle, so there isn’t any way for me to directly guide what sort of description to give. However, whatever you describe has to result in a Blight somehow.

One possibility:

<p class="read-aloud">After seeing that their axes and spears alone don’t do much, the einherjar hurl their spears into the air. Then, imbued with Thor’s might, they rain down as a storm of lightning infused spears.</p>

This will mean you can make a Blight like “Storm of Lightning Spears.”

### Charge Your Weapon

<p class="do-this"><span class="keyword">Mythmaster</span>: check the second charge box on that Weapon, the +2 Dice one.</p>

                                                       +3 Dice  +2 Dice  +2 Might
    Arms forged by the dwarves and gods …is my weapon    ☒☐       ☒☐       ☐☐
      ☐ Intrinsic     ☒ Relic    ☐ Companion

### Roll Dice & Gain Power

<p class="do-this"><span class="keyword">Mythmaster</span>: gather your Storm dice and Thunder dice. Roll them together.</p>

This is identical to the **Roll Dice & Gain Power** step from the Myth’s First Action</a>.

For each Storm die that comes up ![4](/catalog/creators/ryan-macklin/mythender/storm-4.svg), ![5](/catalog/creators/ryan-macklin/mythender/storm-5.svg), or ![6](/catalog/creators/ryan-macklin/mythender/storm-6.svg), gain a Thunder die. Put this in the Thunder pool on your playsheet. You’ll use it in future turns.

For each Thunder die that comes up ![4](/catalog/creators/ryan-macklin/mythender/thunder-4.svg), ![5](/catalog/creators/ryan-macklin/mythender/thunder-5.svg), or ![6](/catalog/creators/ryan-macklin/mythender/thunder-6.svg), gain a Lightning token. Put this into the Lightning pool on your playsheet.

If you gained no Thunder or Lightning this turn, cheat by turning a die to ![storm 4](/catalog/creators/ryan-macklin/mythender/storm-4.svg) as in **If you Gained Nothing**. Explain that you’re cheating for the tutorial.

### Push Forward

<p class="do-this"><span class="keyword">Mythmaster</span>: create your new Blight on a Blight card. Describe what happens in that action’s aftermath.</p>

#### Creating the Blight

<p class="do-this"><span class="keyword">Mythmaster</span>: read the following to the table.</p>

<p class="read-aloud">Now I’m going to create a Blight. To create one, you spend 2 Lightning tokens during the “Push Forward” phase of your turn. Then you’ll do what I’m doing right now. On my next turn, you’ll see how I’ll use it.</p>

<p class="do-this"><span class="keyword">Mythmaster</span>: if you have fewer than 2 Lightning Tokens, take enough so that you now have two, and read the following to the table.</p>

<p class="read-aloud">So, uh, you might have noticed that I just grabbed some extra Lightning. The tutorial just told me to cheat, so that I can show you how Blights work. Normally I can’t just take what I need from the pile—only during this tutorial, when it tells me to.</p>

Create a <span class="keyword">Blight</span> (in **Battling Myths & Gods**), either a scar on the land, an unnatural and dangerous phenomenon, or some other horrible outpouring of Mythic power. To do so, spend 2 Lightning tokens and take a Blight card. See below for an example.

Write on the card a quick description and note the Myth that created it. Check the first charge box. Leave everything else as-is.

> **BLIGHT** ☐ Lasting
>
> Description: Storm of Lightning Spears
>
> Created by: The Einherjar
>
> Charges: ☒▸☐▸☐▸☐▸☐

#### Describe the Aftermath

Take the same advice as before in describing the aftermath, but make it seem deadlier. Now that you’ve created a lasting Blight, the aftermath should be more vicious.

## Mythenders’ Second Actions

### Choosing Who Goes

<p class="do-this"><span class="keyword">Mythmaster</span>: read the following to the table when the Mythenders’ turns start.</p>

<p class="read-aloud">Now that it’s your turn, you can re-choose the order you all go in. You don’t have to choose the whole order right away; one of you can go, and then the rest decide after you see what happens.</p>

<p class="read-aloud">We’ve seen how a Legendary action works. Now we’ll do the next scale up, a Mythic action. This means you’ll roll the Mythic die! The Mythic die is pretty awesome, because you get extra stuff for it, all for the low, low price of corrupting your mortal soul! No biggie.</p>

<p class="read-aloud">During this round, the first person will create a Blight just like I did, and the others will charge that Blight during their actions.</p>

### Form Your Action

<p class="do-this"><span class="keyword">Mythmaster</span>: for the first Mythender’s turn, read the following.</p>

<p class="read-aloud">Like we said earlier, you’re going to use the same Weapon. This will show how to charge a Weapon a second time, and be useful in the next turn when you drain it. But you’re also going to make a Blight, some sort of horrible outpouring of Mythic power that you can use to wound and kill the Myth.</p>

<p class="do-this"><span class="keyword">Mythmaster</span>: for the rest of the Mythenders’ turns, read the following.</p>

<p class="read-aloud">Like we said earlier, you’re going to use the same Weapon. This will show how to charge a Weapon a second time, and be useful in the next turn when you drain it. You’re also going to work in how you’re using the Blight that another Mythender created in your action.</p>

<p class="do-this"><span class="keyword">Player</span>: choose the same Weapon as before. If one of your fellow Mythenders already created a Blight, also choose that Blight.</p>

### Describe Being Awesome

<p class="do-this"><span class="keyword">Player</span>: describe your action. Make sure your Weapon is important in that action, and the Blight if you were able to choose one.</p>

You may need to help guide this description. Since this is a Mythic action, push them to describe something far bolder than last time. But make sure there’s room for something to grow, so that they can do Titanic actions in the next round.

### Charge Your Weapon

<p class="do-this"><span class="keyword">Player</span>: check the second charge box on that Weapon, the one in the +2 Dice column.</p>

                                     +3 Dice  +2 Dice  +2 Might
    A totally badass example           ☒☐       ☒☐       ☐☐
      ☐ Intrinsic     ☒ Relic    ☐ Companion

### Charge the Blight

> Charges: ☒▸☒▸☐▸☐▸☐

<p class="do-this"><span class="keyword">Player</span>: if you used a Blight that was previous created, charge its next charge box.</p>

Since it starts with one charge upon creation, the first time a Mythender uses this Blight in an action, he’ll charge the second charge box. Second time, the third charge box, and so on.

The example to the right shows charging the Blight the first time a Mythender uses it after it’s created.

### Roll Dice & Gain Power

<p class="do-this"><span class="keyword">Player</span>: gather your Storm dice, Thunder dice, and the Mythic Die. If you charged a Blight, add in one bonus Storm die. (Bonus Storm dice are also white.) Roll them together.</p>

For each Thunder die that comes up ![4](/catalog/creators/ryan-macklin/mythender/thunder-4.svg), ![5](/catalog/creators/ryan-macklin/mythender/thunder-5.svg), or ![6](/catalog/creators/ryan-macklin/mythender/thunder-6.svg), gain a Lightning token. Put this into the Lightning pool on your playsheet.

For each Storm die that comes up ![4](/catalog/creators/ryan-macklin/mythender/storm-4.svg), ![5](/catalog/creators/ryan-macklin/mythender/storm-5.svg), or ![6](/catalog/creators/ryan-macklin/mythender/storm-6.svg), gain a Thunder die. Put this in the Thunder pool on your playsheet. You’ll use it in future turns.

Take additional Thunder dice equal to the number on the Mythic die (a ![1](/catalog/creators/ryan-macklin/mythender/mythic-1.svg) means take 1 extra Thunder die, a ![6](/catalog/creators/ryan-macklin/mythender/mythic-6.svg) means take 6 extra Thunder dice). This is in addition to the Thunder dice gained from Storm dice rolled.

_Important_: don’t touch the Mythic die yet. The number on it factors in Suffering Corruption.

If you added in a bonus die from charging a Blight, return it when you’re done.

### Suffer Corruption

Suffering Corruption means dealing with a couple more things. They’re covered in their own tutorial spread, **Suffering Corruption**.

<p class="do-this"><span class="keyword">Mythmaster</span>: jump to that section, deal with it, and then come back here.</p>

### Push Forward

Continue to the next page…

## Mythenders’ Second Action: Push Forward

Continuing from the previous page.

#### If the first Mythender has only 1 Lightning Token

<p class="do-this"><span class="keyword">Mythmaster: explain the Lightning sharing rule in brief.</p>

<p class="read-aloud">One of the reasons that a group of Mythenders is a formidable force is because the Lightning they generate can be shared among them. As long as the Mythender acting can pay for at least half of what he wants to do (rounded up), he can ask for a handout from others. Since a Blight costs 2 Lightning to make, half is 1. So all you need is someone to give you 1 Lightning to pull off a Blight.</p>

<p class="do-this"><span class="keyword">Player</span>: if you have a Blight idea and can get someone else to give you 1 Lightning token, great! You two should add a brief word about how you’re helped out. Then take that Lightning and proceed to the next bit below. If not, proceed to “Otherwise…”</p>

#### On the first Mythender’s turn

<p class="do-this"><span class="keyword">Player</span>: if you have an idea for a Blight, pay 2 Lightning and make one, just like the Mythmaster did. If you don’t, brainstorm with the rest of the table to come up with one. It’s important for the Tutorial that you make one up now.</p>

See the Myth’s Second Turn for more on **creating a Blight**.

<p class="do-this"><span class="keyword">Player</span>: you get to push forward this time! Describe how your action causes the Blight and what it does to your foe. You can accept input from others, including the Mythmaster, but what happens is up to you. (The exception: others can call you on doing something that makes the game not fun for the group.) After that, your turn is over. Proceed to the next Mythender’s turn, or to the next round if everyone has had a turn.</p>

## Suffering Corruption

<p class="do-this"><span class="keyword">Mythmaster</span>: whenever a Mythender rolls the Mythic die (whether doing a Mythic or Titanic Action), do this section. Start by reading the following, if you haven’t yet.</p>

<p class="read-aloud">So you’ve rolled the Mythic die! Congratulations! You’ve taken one step toward becoming a totally awesome god that your friends will probably End, if they survive this adventure. And for that, you get sweet stuff! But now we have to deal with Mythic Corruption and risking a piece of your mortal nature.</p>

### Gain Corruption

<p class="do-this"><span class="keyword">Player</span>: mark a Corruption box. If this is your first time rolling the Mythic Die, you’ll mark the first Corruption box. If this is your second time, you’ll mark the second box.</p>

#### First Corruption Box

    Corruption
    → ☒ 4 → ☐ 4
             ↓
      ☐ 3 ← ☐ 3
      ↓
      ☐ 2 → ☐ 2

#### Second Corruption Box

    Corruption
    → ☒ 4 → ☒ 4
             ↓
      ☐ 3 ← ☐ 3
       ↓
      ☐ 2 → ☐ 2

### Change Form

If a player marked off both boxes on a row, which he will on the third turn because he grabbed the Mythic die a second time, then that Mythender changes form.

<p class="do-this"><span class="keyword">Mythmaster</span>: if the Mythender changes form, read the following. Otherwise, skip this part and move to Progressing Fate, below.</p>

<p class="read-aloud">Now that you’ve checked off both boxes in a row, you change Form! This means that you’ve taken on so much Mythic power that you can no longer keep your mortal Form; it twists to show some aspect of the god you’ll become.</p>

<p class="read-aloud">You wrote down some forms when you made your character (or used a pre-made Mythender). The Paragon Form is now what you look like. This will impact later rules when it comes to dealing with people, since that tends to scare the hell out of mortals.</p>

<p class="do-this"><span class="keyword">Player</span>: if your Mythender has changed form, add that to your action’s description.</p>

The <span class="keyword">Paragon Form</span> comes from that character’s Fate. Here’s an example, from the Eternal Warrior take on the <span class="keyword">God of War</span> Fate (**Mythender Fates**):

    → ☒ 4 → ☒ 4     Paragon Form: I appear as… A warrior with a halo of steel  and blood over my head

### Progress Fate

<p class="do-this"><span class="keyword">Player</span>: compare the number on the Mythic Die with the number in the Corruption box you checked. If the Mythic Die is equal or higher, you’re forced to progress your Fate.</p>

Since this tutorial only has you checking off the first two boxes, the Corruption number will be 4. So if the Mythic die comes up ![4](/catalog/creators/ryan-macklin/mythender/mythic-4.svg), ![5](/catalog/creators/ryan-macklin/mythender/mythic-5.svg), or ![6](/catalog/creators/ryan-macklin/mythender/mythic-6.svg), then the Mythender’s Fate is progressed.

#### If Fate isn’t progressing

<p class="do-this"><span class="keyword">Mythmaster</span>: if the player isn’t progressing Fate, read the following.</p>

<p class="read-aloud">The Mythic die was low, so you aren’t forced to give up your mortality. However, you can still choose to…</p>

<p class="do-this"><span class="keyword">Mythmaster</span>: ask the player if he’d like to progress his Fate. If so, continue on. Otherwise, go to the rest you left off.</p>

#### If Fate is progressing

<p class="do-this"><span class="keyword">Mythmaster</span>: if the player is progressing Fate, read the following.</p>

<p class="read-aloud">Awesome! Not only did you push your Corruption, you’ve lost a piece of your mortality! That’s great! Each time you lose part of your soul, you get a new slot for a Gift—special tricks that let you change how the battle rules work.</p>

<p class="read-aloud">We’re not going to get into the specific on Gifts right now, but after that battle is over, you’ll get to fill in these new slots with awesome stuff!</p>

<p class="do-this"><span class="keyword">Player</span>: check off the next available Fate box.</p>

If this is the first time this Mythender has progressed Fate, check off the first box. If this is the second time, check off the second box.

#### First Fate Box

    ☒ • Grievous Harm
    ☒ • ______________
    ☐ • ______________

#### Second Fate Box

    ☒ • Grievous Harm
    ☒ • ______________

## Myth’s Third Action

<p class="do-this"><span class="keyword">Mythmaster</span>: read the following to the table.</p>

<p class="read-aloud">We’re going to start the last tutorial round now. On my third turn, I’ll: pick a Weapon, pick the Blight I made, describe the action, and then I’ll totally Wound some of you. I’ll use the same Weapon as I did before, but instead of charging a box, I’m going to drain the boxes I charged.</p>

<p class="read-aloud">Now we get to explore the fun of getting Wounded! Woo! And this round, we’ll talk about those Gifts you have.</p>

### Claim Might

<p class="do-this"><span class="keyword">Mythmaster</span>: claim 2 Might tokens. Re-explain why if necessary.</p>

### Form Your Action

<p class="do-this"><span class="keyword">Mythmaster</span>: choose the same Weapon as before, and choose the Blight you created last time.</p>

### Describe Being Awesome

<p class="do-this"><span class="keyword">Mythmaster</span>: describe your action. Make sure your Weapon and the Blight are important in that action. You must describe hurting at least one Mythender during this process, which shouldn’t be a problem.</p>

Again, describe your action involving this Weapon, but you’ll also have to involve the Blight; otherwise, you’re not allowed to get any benefit from it. Describe something that could hurt most or all of the Mythenders, or you’re not allowed to Wound them with Push Forward.

### Drain Your Weapon

<p class="do-this"><span class="keyword">Mythmaster</span>: check the first and second drain boxes on your Weapon. Then say the following to the players.</p>

                                                       +3 Dice  +2 Dice  +2 Might
    Arms forged by the dwarves and gods …is my weapon    ☒☒       ☒☒       ☐☐
      ☐ Intrinsic     ☒ Relic    ☐ Companion

<p class="read-aloud">Now that I’m draining a weapon, I get to check off the drain box for each column with a check in the charge box. I get to add those bonuses to the dice I’m rolling this turn as bonus Storm dice, 5 in this case. You probably also see that the third column says “+2 Might”—if you drain that box, you immediately gain 2 Might tokens as well.</p>

### Charge the Blight

> Charges: ☒▸☒▸☒▸☒▸☐

<p class="do-this"><span class="keyword">Mythmaster</span>: check off one charge box for each Mythender you’re fighting. If you’re dealing with three, you’ll check off three, as in the example to the right. Then read the following.</p>

<p class="read-aloud">You’ll see that I checked off some charge boxes on the Blight. I got to check off one for each of you. On your turns, you’ll see more on this, and on draining a Blight.</p>

### Roll Dice & Gain Power

<p class="do-this"><span class="keyword">Mythmaster</span>: gather your Storm dice and Thunder dice, then gather 5 bonus Storm dice. Roll them together.</p>

This process is almost identical to your second turn. You get one bonus Storm die this turn for charging the Blight, and you’ll interrupt it by using a Gift.

#### Introducing the Relentlessness Gift

_Important_: if all of your Thunder dice are successful, turn one of them to be ![1](/catalog/creators/ryan-macklin/mythender/thunder-1.svg). Explain you’re doing this for tutorial purposes.

<p class="do-this"><span class="keyword">Mythmaster</span>: if you have any failures on your Thunder dice, read and do the following.</p>

<p class="read-aloud">I’m going to show you have a Gift works. My Myth has a Gift called “Relentlessness,” which means that I can reroll failed dice. If I pay 2 Might tokens, I can take all the failures from one die type—Storm or Thunder—and reroll them. Now, I can only do this once a round; Gifts only work once a round unless they say otherwise.</p>

<p class="do-this"><span class="keyword">Mythmaster</span>: pay 2 Might tokens, and reroll all your failed Thunder dice.</p>

Now gather Storm and Thunder as normal. Once you have, put the bonus Storm dice back.

### Push Forward

<p class="do-this"><span class="keyword">Mythmaster</span>: read the follow to the victims…I mean, the players.</p>

<p class="read-aloud">Hey, how are you doing? I’m doing great. You know why? Because I’m totally going to Wound you now. But on the bright side, you’re learning it now so that you can do it to me on your turns!</p>

For this, it’s important to not Wound everyone, even if you’re able to. Choose one person who has at least six Thunder dice to not be Wounded this turn, so that they keep all those dice for their action. Among the others, choose at least two to Wound.

_Note_: if you for some reason don’t have 3 Lightning tokens by now, take enough to make three, and explain you’re cheating for tutorial purposes.

<p class="read-aloud">Now I’m going to Wound some of you: [Names of the Mythenders you’re Wounding]. Know that the only reason I can is because I described it possibly happening in my action. For the first person, I have to pay your Wound Cost, which you’ll see on your sheet is 3.</p>

<p class="do-this"><span class="keyword">Mythmaster</span>: pay 3 Lightning tokens, then read the following.</p>

<p class="read-aloud">That’s to Wound one of you. As a Myth, I have a special rule about wounding multiple Mythenders: I can spend 1 Might token for each additional Mythender I want to Wound. It still has to make sense with what I described earlier.</p>

<p class="do-this"><span class="keyword">Mythmaster</span>: pay 1 Might Token for each additional Mythender you’re wounding, and then proceed to the Being Wounded section.</p>

Once you’re done with the Mythenders being Wounded and the aftermath description, proceed to the Mythenders’ turns. And kiss goodbye to your petty little Myth.

## Wounding the Mythenders

<p class="do-this"><span class="keyword">Mythmaster</span>: read the following.</p>

<p class="read-aloud">Now we’re going to explore the joys of being Wounded! Yay! This will involve your Thunder dice and the Wound track on your playsheet.</p>

What you’ll do here is walk the players through being Wounded, which means checking off a Wound box, rolling for the Wound, and possibly dying. The players addressed in this section are specifically those who were targeted.

### Check Your Wound Box

     WOUNDS
     ☒ 3
       ↓
     ☐ 4
       ↓
     ☐ 5
       ↓
       6

Since this is the one time the Mythenders will be Wounded in this tutorial, they’ll check off the first box, which is a 3.

<p class="do-this"><span class="keyword">Mythmaster</span>: read the following.</p>

<p class="read-aloud">If you’re wounded, you’re going to start by checking off your first available Wound box, the one listed as “3”. That’s your Wound number, which we’re going to use in the next step. You won’t get Wounded again during this battle, but if you were again, you’d check off the next one—the “4”.</p>

<p class="do-this"><span class="keyword">Players</span>: check off the first available Wound box, the 3 one.</p>

### Roll Your Wound

<p class="do-this"><span class="keyword">Mythmaster</span>: read the following.</p>

<p class="read-aloud">Now that you’ve checked off your Wound box, you’re going to use the number next to it—the Wound number—to see how horrible and messed up this attack has made you. Gather up your Thunder dice, and just those dice. Then roll them. Anything that’s less than that number 
(<img src="thunder-1.svg" alt="1"> or <img src="thunder-2.svg" alt="2">) are discarded, put back into the general pile. Anything that’s that or higher (<img src="thunder-3.svg" alt="3">, <img src="thunder-4.svg" alt="4">, <img src="thunder-5.svg" alt="5">, or <img src="thunder-6.svg" alt="6">) you get to keep…for now.</p>

<p class="do-this"><span class="keyword">Players</span>: roll your Thunder dice. Keep any that are <img src="thunder-3.svg" alt="3"> (your Wound number) or higher. Discard any that are less than <img src="thunder-3.svg" alt="3">.</p>

### Are you Dead?

<p class="do-this"><span class="keyword">Mythmaster</span>: read the following.</p>

<p class="read-aloud">Anyone who loses all their Thunder dice are dead. Well, sort of. Mythenders have a say in the matter.</p>

<p class="do-this"><span class="keyword">Mythmaster</span>: if any player has no Thunder dice due to this Wound, read the following.</p>

<p class="read-aloud">And looks like we have a fatality! We’ll get to you once we take care of everyone else.</p>

<p class="do-this"><span class="keyword">Mythmaster</span>: if no players have lost all Thunder dice, read the following.</p>

<p class="read-aloud">And looks like everyone’s still alive. Thankfully, the rules say I can’t just kill one of you to demonstrate the rules. But if anyone would like to volunteer…</p>

If someone wants to volunteer to die, they can discard all their Thunder dice. But it’s okay if no one wants to die this early in the game.

### Mythenders Who Aren’t Dead

<p class="do-this"><span class="keyword">Mythmaster</span>: Read the following.</p>

<p class="read-aloud">Take your remaining Thunder dice back into your pool.</p>

_Note_: sometimes you won’t lose any dice on a Wound roll. If that happens, tell the player that they’re lucky this time, but that they’re still Wounded, and the next time they get Wounded, they’ll have to deal with a higher Wound number.

### Mythenders Who Are Dead

<p class="do-this"><span class="keyword">Mythmaster</span>: Jump to the section on dead Mythenders below.</p>

### Check Companions

<p class="do-this"><span class="keyword">Mythmaster</span>: Read the following to the Wounded players.</p>

<p class="read-aloud">Now we’ll get into the different Weapon types, specifically Companions. See, your Companions really, really hate when you get Wounded. Because of that, when you’re Wounded, they get a free charge. Check off one of the Charge boxes on any Companion Weapons you have. If you don’t have any Companion Weapons, you don’t get any special benefit.</p>

### The Bloodlust Gift

<p class="do-this"><span class="keyword">Mythmaster</span>: Read the following to the table.</p>

<p class="read-aloud">There’s a Gift called “Bloodlust,” which is something you can use when you’re Wounded. It lets you turn the Thunder dice you lost into Lightning tokens you use to return the favor.</p>

<p class="do-this"><span class="keyword">Player</span>: if you have the Bloodlust Gift, you may spend 2 Might tokens. If you do, gain a number of Lightning tokens equal to the number of Thunder dice you just lost.</p>

### Describe the Aftermath

<p class="do-this"><span class="keyword">Mythmaster</span>: Describe the aftermath of this action. Get really brutal and messy with how the Mythenders are finally Wounded in a way they could feel. If any Mythenders died, describe killing them. Then go back.</p>

## Dead Mythenders

<p class="do-this"><span class="keyword">Mythmaster</span>: read the following.</p>

<p class="read-aloud">So, you’re out of Thunder dice. Normally, that means you’re dead. But let me ask you a question: do you want to stay dead? You don’t have to. As a Mythender, being dead is a choice—if you choose to stay dead right now, then you’re forever dead, as a mortal. But you could instead choose to let your Mythic Heart save you, at the low, low price of permanently corrupting you. No big deal.</p>

<p class="read-aloud">Since this is a tutorial, what do you say we get to the good part and bring you back from the dead. You don’t want to be slaughtered by a bunch of punk lesser Myths, right?</p>

#### Aside: The Mortal Choice to Die

The Mortal Choice is easy, the character is just dead, the game is over for him. And it can be a powerful story choice, when you’re fighting a god and you’re in danger of becoming a Myth at the end of that fight. But that’s for a later time.

### The Mythic Choice to Survive

<p class="do-this"><span class="keyword">Player</span>: tell the Mythmaster that you’re going to survive this death. Feel free to add whatever wit or profanity you feel is appropriate. It’s not every day you get killed and then get to say “Actually, no I don’t.”</p>

#### Progressing Corruption & Fate

<p class="do-this"><span class="keyword">Mythmaster</span>: read the following.</p>

<p class="read-aloud">Next up, you’re going to check off one more Corruption box and one more Fate box. Embracing your Mythic nature to come back from the dead is a Big Deal, and it brings you closer to becoming a Myth.</p>

<p class="do-this"><span class="keyword">Player</span>: check your next Corruption box and Fate box. This means you’ll have two Corruption boxes checked now, so when you describe coming back to life, include how you change form with that.</p>

See **Suffering Corruption** for those details.

#### Gaining Permanent Corruption & Fate

<p class="do-this"><span class="keyword">Mythmaster</span>: read the following.</p>

<p class="read-aloud">Now that we’ve increased your Corruption and Fate, we’re going to make some of those boxes permanent. Normally, when you seek sympathy from a mortal during an interlude, you can heal your Corruption and Fate to keep yourself from becoming a Myth. But each time you die, that becomes harder to do.</p>

<p class="do-this"><span class="keyword">Player</span>: draw a circle around the first Corruption box you checked and the first Fate box you checked. These are “Permanent Corruption boxes” and “Permanent Fate boxes.”</p>

#### Permanent Corruption Box

#### Getting Back into the Battle

<p class="do-this"><span class="keyword">Mythmaster</span>: read the following.</p>

<p class="read-aloud">Last thing: now that you’re ready to fight again, you’re going to need more Thunder dice, right? You get an amount based on your current Form, just as you do at the beginning of every battle. For now being at Paragon form, that means 2 Thunder dice.</p>

<p class="do-this"><span class="keyword">Player</span>: take 2 Thunder dice from the pile and put them in your pool</p>

<p class="do-this"><span class="keyword">Mythmaster</span>: read the following.</p>

<p class="read-aloud">I’m about to describe the aftermath now. During that, I’m going to describe killing you. Then, when I’m done and before anyone else goes, you take a moment to describe coming back from dead however you want. You can do this right now, or you can wait until your action on the next round. Include changing Form when describing coming back, since both boxes in your first Corruption row are checked.</p>

<p class="do-this"><span class="keyword">Player</span>: after the Mythmaster describes killing your Mythender, get all sickhouse in describing how he comes back to life.</p>

#### The Bloodlust Gift

If you have the <span class="keyword">Bloodlust</span> Gift, you may use it after you come back from death, in which case you’ll get even more Lightning! Treat all the Thunder dice you lost as Lightning tokens gained; don’t subtract the new Thunder dice you have from coming back.

## The Mythenders’ Third Round

The third round is slightly more complicated for you, the Mythmaster, to direct, because you’re going to have the Mythenders all do something slightly different. Rather than let the player’s organize their turn as they did turning the first two rounds, you’ll organize them in order to introduce new sets of rules.

<p class="do-this"><span class="keyword">Mythmaster</span>: before the Mythenders take their turns in the third round, read the following.</p>

<p class="read-aloud">Normally you get to organize your order each round, but for this tutorial, I’m going to order you on this round in order to showcase different rules.</p>

This is because you’re introducing four concepts: Wounding the Myth, draining a Blight, the Titanic action, and other Gifts the Mythenders have.

<p class="do-this"><span class="keyword">Mythmaster</span>: for the first turn, pick the person with the lowest amount of Thunder dice…unless they have the Grievous Harm gift, in which case pick someone else with a low amount.</p>

This will be a Mythic action where their Blight is drained and the Myth is Wounded. Use the **Mythenders’ Third Action: Mythic/Draining** step.

<p class="do-this"><span class="keyword">Mythmaster</span>: for the second turn, pick the person with the highest amount of Thunder dice.</p>

This will be a Titanic action, and the Myth will be Wounded. Use the **Mythenders’ Third Action: Titanic** step.

<p class="do-this"><span class="keyword">Mythmaster</span>: if you haven’t picked someone with the Grievous Harm Gift yet, and one of the Mythenders has that Gift, then pick that person. Otherwise, allow the remaining players to go in whatever order they like.</p>

At this point, the rest of the tutorial is freeform. You have taught all the concepts contained here. Make sure everyone gets a chance to Wound the Myth. Use their special <span class="keyword">Practice Death</span> Gift, or cheat and add a couple Thunder dice to their pool if they run out.

If the round ends and the Myth is still alive, discard all your dice and declare that it’s dead. Let the Mythenders describe the battle’s aftermath as normal.

As always, when you’re cheating for the tutorial, explain that you are.

## Mythenders’ Third Action: Mythic/Draining

<p class="do-this"><span class="keyword">Mythmaster</span>: read the following.</p>

<p class="read-aloud">This action is going to be a Mythic Action, just like the last one you did. You’ll use the same Weapon as before, but this time you’ll drain it. And you’ll drain the Blight. If you have enough Lightning, you’ll also get some revenge by Wounding me.</p>

### Form Your Action

<p class="do-this"><span class="keyword">Player</span>: choose the same Weapon as before. Choose the Blight you’ve created.</p>

### Describe Being Awesome

<p class="do-this"><span class="keyword">Mythmaster</span>: read the following.</p>

<p class="read-aloud"> So, the thing about this world is that you can wound Myths in a number of ways. The obvious is physical combat, but anything that assaults them psychologically and destroys their resolve to fight also causes them to die. If you make these guys feel fear or shame, or even things like you forgiving them, those all cause Wounds…as long as you have a Weapon that’s relevant.</p>

<p class="do-this"><span class="keyword">Player</span>: describe your Mythic action. Make sure your Weapon and the Blight are important to the action. Describe something that will damage the Myth.</p>

Again, guide the player if needed. Make sure all the key bits are hit, so you can show
everything in this tutorial step.

### Drain Your Weapon

<p class="do-this"><span class="keyword">Mythmaster</span>: read the following.</p>

<p class="read-aloud">You’re going to drain the charge boxes on your Weapon, just like I did.</p>

<p class="do-this"><span class="keyword">Player</span>: check the first and second drain boxes on your Weapon. If your third box is also checked, because you’ve been using a Companion Weapon and were Wounded, check the third drain box as well. You always drain every charged box on your Weapon.</p>

                                     +3 Dice  +2 Dice  +2 Might
    A totally badass example           ☒☒       ☒☒       ☐☐
      ☐ Intrinsic     ☒ Relic    ☐ Companion

Have the player take 5 bonus Storm dice. If the <span class="keyword">+2 Might</span> box was drained, also have them
take 2 Might tokens. Explain that these tokens aren’t temporary like bonus dice.

### Drain the Blight

<p class="do-this"><span class="keyword">Mythmaster</span>: Read the following.</p>

<p class="read-aloud">By now, most or all of the charge boxes on your Blight are checked. Now we’re going to drain the Blight. You’ll grab a number of bonus Thunder dice equal to the boxes charged, and then you’ll erase all the charges.</p>

<p class="do-this"><span class="keyword">Player</span>: take a number of red bonus Thunder dice equal to the charges on the Blight, and then erase the charge checks.</p>

<p class="read-aloud">The Blight’s now drained, but it’s still around. You can recharge it in future turns.</p>

### Roll Dice & Gain Power

<p class="do-this"><span class="keyword">Player</span>: gather your Storm dice, normal and bonus Thunder dice, and the Mythic Die. Roll them together.</p>

For each permanent Thunder die that comes up ![4](/catalog/creators/ryan-macklin/mythender/thunder-4.svg), ![5](/catalog/creators/ryan-macklin/mythender/thunder-5.svg), or ![6](/catalog/creators/ryan-macklin/mythender/thunder-6.svg), gain a Lightning token. Put this into the Lightning pool on your playsheet.

For each bonus Thunder die that comes up ![4](/catalog/creators/ryan-macklin/mythender/bonus-4.svg), ![5](/catalog/creators/ryan-macklin/mythender/bonus-5.svg), or ![6](/catalog/creators/ryan-macklin/mythender/bonus-6.svg), gain a Lightning token. Put this into the Lightning pool on your playsheet.

For each Storm die that comes up ![4](/catalog/creators/ryan-macklin/mythender/storm-4.svg), ![5](/catalog/creators/ryan-macklin/mythender/storm-5.svg), or ![6](/catalog/creators/ryan-macklin/mythender/storm-6.svg), gain a Thunder die. Put this in the Thunder pool on your playsheet. You’ll use it in future turns.

Take additional Thunder dice equal to the number on the Mythic die (a ![1](/catalog/creators/ryan-macklin/mythender/mythic-1.svg) means take 1 extra Thunder die, a ![6](/catalog/creators/ryan-macklin/mythender/mythic-6.svg) means take 6 extra Thunder dice). This is in addition to the Thunder dice gained from Storm.

Once you’ve gained everything, put the bonus storm and bonus Thunder dice back. Don’t touch the Mythic die, because you’ll need the value it rolled when you Suffer Corruption.

#### Using the Relentlessness Gift

<p class="do-this">If the Mythender has the Relentlessness Gift, before they discard the bonus Storm and bonus Thunder, suggest that they use the Relentlessness Gift</p>

This would be just like you did on your turn (**Myth’s Third Action**), so use that as a reference. Note that when using this Gift, bonus Storm dice can also be rerolled if the player picks Storm, and bonus Thunder can be rerolled if Thunder is chosen.

<p class="do-this">If the Mythender doesn’t have the Relentlessness Gift, but has a Gift slot open from progressing Fate at least once, the read the following.</p>

<p class="read-aloud">You have an open Gift slot, which means that, at any time, you can fill that in with a new Gift. If you’d like to reroll some of those failures, you can pick the Relentlessness Gift right this moment, and then pay 2 Might to reroll either your Storm or Thunder failures.</p>

If they chose to, direct them in using that Gift.

### Suffer Corruption

<p class="do-this"><span class="keyword">Mythmaster and Player</span>: jump back to that section (Suffering Corruption), deal with it, and then come back here.</p>

### Push Forward & Wound

<p class="do-this"><span class="keyword">Mythmaster and Player</span>: follow the step for Wounding the Myth.</p>

## Mythenders’ Third Action: Titanic

<p class="do-this"><span class="keyword">Mythmaster</span>: read the following.</p>

<p class="read-aloud">Now we’ll introduce the highest scale of action: the Titanic action. You’ll need to describe something much more dramatic than any of the Mythic actions so far. You can rip the land in half with a simple swing of a sword, turn the sky into ice with a glance, or anything else that you can imagine…provided you can describe it with one of your Weapons. Also look at your Fate: for instance, if you’re a God of Death, you can describe raising the dead as a Titanic action.</p>

<p class="read-aloud">You’ll use the same Weapon as before, but this time you’ll drain it. You’ll charge the Blight again. And you’ll Wound me.</p>

_Note_: this step assumes that the Mythenders’ Blight has already been drained.

### Form Your Action

<p class="do-this"><span class="keyword">Player</span>: choose the same Weapon as before. Choose the Blight you’ve created.</p>

### Describe Being Awesome

<p class="do-this"><span class="keyword">Player</span>: describe your Titanic action. Make sure the Weapon and Blight are important to the action. Describe something that will damage the Myth. It shouldn’t be hard.</p>

You should guide the player into describing a Titanic action. If it helps, goad the player after getting a weaker description than necessary, as per the **Challenge the Mythenders at Times** section of the Mythmaster’s chapter. Saying “Oh, is that all?” or similar may help, if the table has a sense of esprit de corps.

### Drain Your Weapon

<p class="do-this"><span class="keyword">Mythmaster</span>: read the following.</p>

<p class="read-aloud">You’re going to drain the charge boxes on your Weapon, just like I did.</p>

<p class="do-this"><span class="keyword">Player</span>: check the first and second drain boxes on your Weapon. If your third box is also checked, because you’ve been using a Companion Weapon and were Wounded, check the third drain box as well.</p>

                                     +3 Dice  +2 Dice  +2 Might
    A totally badass example           ☒☒       ☒☒       ☐☐
      ☐ Intrinsic     ☒ Relic    ☐ Companion

<p class="do-this"><span class="keyword">Mythmaster</span>: read the following.</p>

<p class="read-aloud">Okay, here’s where the rules change rather drastically from anything else you’ve done so far. First of all, you don’t roll any Storm dice when you do a Titanic action. That means you can’t take any bonus Storm dice from draining your Weapon. But when you drain a Weapon, you have another option: take bonus Thunder dice instead.</p>

<p class="read-aloud">It normally costs you 2 Might to do so, but if you’re using a Relic Weapon, it’s free. However, you can’t mix your bonuses; you either take it all as bonus Storm or all as bonus Thunder.</p>

<p class="do-this"><span class="keyword">Player</span>: if your Weapon is a Relic, take 5 bonus Thunder dice. If your Weapon isn’t a Relic, pay 2 Might tokens and then take 5 bonus Thunder dice. If you also drained the +2 Might box, take 2 Might tokens now.</p>

### Charge the Blight

<p class="do-this"><span class="keyword">Mythmaster</span>: read the following.</p>

<p class="read-aloud">Now you get to charge the Blight. Remember how I said that you don’t roll Storm dice on a Titanic action? That means you won’t get the bonus Storm die for the Blight. However, you can still charge it, so you or another Mythender can take advantage of that later.</p>

<p class="do-this"><span class="keyword">Player</span>: charge the Blight by checking its highest unchecked box.</p>

### Roll Dice & Gain Power

<p class="do-this"><span class="keyword">Mythmaster</span>: read the following.</p>

<p class="read-aloud">Here’s the last bit about a Titanic action. When you roll, all your successes generate 3 Lightning tokens each. So if you get 4 successes, that’s 12 Lightning! Enough to really put the hurt on me. But there’s a downside: you have to discard all your failures, which means you’ll get a bit hurt and might even die from it. No risk, no reward!</p>

<p class="read-aloud">Oh, and this is the way to get a lot of Might at once. The Mythic die doesn’t give you more Thunder dice this time. It gives you more Might, which you can spend immediately.</p>

<p class="do-this"><span class="keyword">Player</span>: gather your normal and bonus Thunder dice, and the Mythic die. Roll them.</p>

For each permanent Thunder die that comes up ![4](/catalog/creators/ryan-macklin/mythender/thunder-4.svg), ![5](/catalog/creators/ryan-macklin/mythender/thunder-5.svg), or ![6](/catalog/creators/ryan-macklin/mythender/thunder-6.svg), gain 3 Lightning tokens. Put this into the Lightning pool on your playsheet.

For each bonus Thunder die that comes up ![4](/catalog/creators/ryan-macklin/mythender/bonus-4.svg), ![5](/catalog/creators/ryan-macklin/mythender/bonus-5.svg), or ![6](/catalog/creators/ryan-macklin/mythender/bonus-6.svg), gain 3 Lightning tokens. Put this into the Lightning pool on your playsheet.

Take additional Might tokens equal to the number on the Mythic Die (a ![1](/catalog/creators/ryan-macklin/mythender/mythic-1.svg) means take 1 extra Might token, a ![6](/catalog/creators/ryan-macklin/mythender/mythic-6.svg) means take 6 extra Might tokens).

Discard each permanent Thunder die that comes up ![1](/catalog/creators/ryan-macklin/mythender/thunder-1.svg), ![2](/catalog/creators/ryan-macklin/mythender/thunder-2.svg), or ![3](/catalog/creators/ryan-macklin/mythender/thunder-3.svg). If that means you lose all your Thunder dice, then you’ve died. That’s okay, you’ll get better. See **Dead Mythenders**, then come back here.

Once you’ve gained everything, put the bonus Thunder dice back.

#### Using the Relentlessness Gift

You may wish to explain the <span class="keyword">Relentlessness</span> Gift, as with the other version of a Mythender’s third turn. However, for a Titanic action, it costs 4 Might tokens to use.

### Suffer Corruption

<p class="do-this"><span class="keyword">Mythmaster and Player</span>: jump back to that section (Suffering Corruption), deal with it, and then come back here.</p>

### Push Forward & Wounding

<p class="do-this"><span class="keyword">Mythmaster and Player</span>: follow the step for Wounding the Myth.</p>

## Wounding the Myth

<p class="do-this"><span class="keyword">Mythmaster</span>: read the following the first time you’re Wounded.</p>

<p class="read-aloud">Now you’re going to Wound me! I’m going to do the same thing as you, where I’ll check off a Wound box and roll my Thunder dice to see if the Myth is still alive.</p>

<p class="read-aloud">This Myth has the same Wound boxes that you do, but when you’re fighting gods, they’ll have more boxes on their Wound tracks.</p>

<p class="do-this"><span class="keyword">Mythmaster</span>: read the following.</p>

<p class="read-aloud">The Wound costs for the Myths vary. This Myth is weak, and its Wound cost is only 4 Lightning.</p>

<p class="do-this"><span class="keyword">Player</span>: pay 4 Lightning. You may share as before, but you must pay at least half the amount (2).</p>

#### Doubling Down

<p class="do-this"><span class="keyword">Mythmaster</span>: the third time you’re Wounded, introduce this section and read below.</p>

<p class="read-aloud">There’s another way you can increase the Wound number: by paying double the Wound cost in Lightning.</p>

<p class="do-this"><span class="keyword">Player</span>: you may pay twice as much Lightning (8) to double down. If you’re sharing, then you must pay at least half the total (4).</p>

#### Check Your Wound Box

<p class="do-this"><span class="keyword">Mythmaster</span>: check off your next available Wound box, and tell the Mythenders what your Wound number is.</p>

The first time you’re wounded, check the 3 box. Second time, check the 4. Third time, check the 5. You won’t check anything after that, as you’ll be out of Wound boxes.

Whatever number you checked off is your Wound Number, just as when the Mythenders were Wounded. If you ran out of boxes, then your Wound number is 6.

#### The Grievous Harm Gift

<p class="do-this"><span class="keyword">Mythmaster</span>: the second time you’re Wounded, introduce this section and read the following.</p>

<p class="read-aloud">There’s a gift that some of you [have/may have], called Grievous Harm. Since you can’t Wound me twice in one turn, this is how you make a Wound more vicious. If you have it, you can pay 2 Might to increase my Wound number by one. It doesn’t change which box I check, just what I have to roll to keep my Thunder dice.</p>

<p class="do-this"><span class="keyword">Player</span>: if you have the Grievous Harm Gift, you may use it. If you don’t, but you have an open Gift slot, you may take it right now and use it, before the Mythmaster rolls for the Wound.</p>

### Roll Your Wound

<p class="do-this"><span class="keyword">Mythmaster</span>: roll your Thunder dice. Keep any that are equal to or higher than your Wound number. Discard any that are less.</p>

If the players raised your Wound number to 7 due to the <span class="keyword">Grievous Harm</span> Gift, then you will start by discarding everything that isn’t a ![6](/catalog/creators/ryan-macklin/mythender/thunder-6.svg), and then discard one ![6](/catalog/creators/ryan-macklin/mythender/thunder-6.svg). If the Wound number is 8, discard two ![6](/catalog/creators/ryan-macklin/mythender/thunder-6.svg)s.

#### The Bloodlust Gift

Your Myth should have the <span class="keyword">Bloodlust</span> Gift. Demonstrate it by using it, even if you’ve already explained it. This helps cement to the players that the Myths can and will have the sort of dirty tricks they do.

If you haven’t explained it yet, do so as per **Wounding the Mythenders**.

### If You’re Out of Thunder Dice

<p class="do-this"><span class="keyword">Mythmaster</span>: if you’re out of Thunder dice, but not everyone else has had a chance to go this round, read the following. Then grab 2 Thunder dice from the pile and go back to Push Forward on the Mythender’s turn.</p>

<p class="read-aloud">So, you’ve killed me. Sweet! Unlike you guys, the Myths don’t have a choice to make. When they’re dead, they’re dead (though sometimes a god will have a Gift that lets them cheat).</p>

<p class="read-aloud">Normally, the battle would be over, but since this is a tutorial, I have to cheat so everyone gets a chance to do a third turn.</p>

<p class="do-this"><span class="keyword">Mythmaster</span>: if you’re out of Thunder dice, and everyone has had a chance to go this round, read the following. Then proceed to the Battle Epilogue.</p>

<p class="read-aloud">So, you’ve killed me. Awesome! Unlike you guys, the Myths don’t have a choice to make. When they’re dead, they’re dead (though sometimes a god will have a Gift that lets them cheat). Now let’s finish up this battle.</p>

Now proceed to the Battle Epilogue.

### If You’re Not Out of Thunder Dice

<p class="do-this"><span class="keyword">Mythmaster</span>: if this is the last turn of the round, and you still have Thunder dice, discard them all. Then read the following and proceed to the Battle Epilogue.</p>

<p class="read-aloud">Okay, technically the Myth is still alive. But the tutorial is over, so I’m going to discard all my dice and declare the Myth dead. Let’s face it, it was on the ropes and you were going to End it in a turn or two anyway. Nothing much I could do. Let’s finish up this battle.</p>

Now proceed to the Battle Epilogue.

Otherwise…

<p class="do-this"><span class="keyword">Player</span>: if the Myth still has Thunder dice and this isn’t the last turn of the round, you get to describe how you’ve Wounded it. Get vicious about it. Then the turn goes to the next player.</p>

## Battle Epilogue

### Describe the End

<p class="do-this"><span class="keyword">Mythmaster</span>: read the following to the table.</p>

<p class="read-aloud">You have Ended the einherjar! Now we’re going to go around the table, and everyone, including me, will describe some bit of the end.</p>

Start with the Mythender who Ended this Myth, and have them finish Push Forward, describing how the battle Ends because of their action. Then have the other Mythenders chime in with a bit. Finally, add some description yourself. This is collaborative, so build on each other’s description and help each other make this narrative as awesome as it deserves to be.

For a bit of added fun, have the player who Ended the Myth rip up your Myth sheet. (Unless you want to reuse it or something.)

### Resting

<p class="do-this"><span class="keyword">Mythmaster</span>: read the following to the table.</p>

<p class="read-aloud">Next we’ll reset your Mythenders’ playsheets, as you now have a moment to rest.</p>

First, their Wound boxes all get unchecked—taking a moment to breathe after a battle is enough to give their Mythic Heart time to heal them.

Second, they’ll discard all their Thunder dice and Lightning tokens—the battle is over and the moment is calm, so all that power goes back into the Mythic World. Might tokens are yours to own and wield, so any you have left over are kept for the next battle.

Finally, they’ll deal with their Weapons. Any boxes that have been charged and drained get both boxes erased. As for as the charges that haven’t been drained…

<p class="do-this"><span class="keyword">Mythmaster</span>: read the following to the table.</p>

<p class="read-aloud">Okay, for the charges not drained, they’re normally also lost. But there are two exceptions. First, Intrinsic Weapons always keep their undrained charges after a battle—your sword may be sheathed and your Companions may take a rest, but your innate qualities never stop raging on.</p>

<p class="read-aloud">Second, you can preserve the undrained charges on your Relic and Companion Weapons by pouring some Might into them. For each charge you want to keep, spend 1 Might token.</p>

Then help direct them in this regard. They don’t have to spend Might tokens if they don’t want to, but encourage them, because the god they’ll be fighting is no pushover.

### Gathering Rage: Claim a Blight

<p class="do-this"><span class="keyword">Mythmaster</span>: read the following to the table.</p>

<p class="read-aloud">Myths have things they do at the end of every round they’re still alive, called Gathering Rage. Lesser Myths, like these einherjar, have effects that happen at the end of the battle, the aftermath. Because these einherjar lived to the end of the second round, I get to turn one of the Blights created into a lasting Blight that the Myth can use. It doesn’t matter who made this Blight; the Myth now owns it as a lasting one.</p>

<p class="read-aloud">If this Myth had survived the third round, it would have given the god ahead more power by giving it another charge box to check. So it’s really important to slaughter Myths as soon as you can!</p>

<p class="read-aloud">Greater Myths and gods, like the one you’ll face down soon, have Gathering Rage triggers that give them more power and do other things during the battle. So expect that to happen.</p>

Pick a Blight that was made and check the Lasting box on it. If you pick a Mythender’s Blight, scratch out their name and put “Mythic Norden” instead. It’s no longer that Mythender’s Blight. (This usually pisses the Mythender off. Great! Show them how that which they create in battle can scar the land and destroy the lives of mortals.)

### The Other Blights

All the other Blights are discarded once the battle is over, as they aren’t lasting.

## What to Think About During a Battle

<span class="mythender">Mythender’s</span> battle system works like an ensemble cast comic book or action movie. Someone does something kick-ass, then the next person does something, and so on. Sometimes the person kicking ass is a hero, sometimes a villain. It can take the shape of sparring, when two combatants follow one another, but often it’s a camera change, focusing on the next person to do something awesome.

These battles are vast, taking place over a large space and a large number of combatants. Thecast can range from five to five thousand, the space of a football field to several square miles. It may stay on the ground, or the heavens may open with people falling and flying. The only bound is your imagination and desire—some fights are better when they’re small, and some are meant to be vast.

### Battles in Media

Any epic ensemble cast fight sequence will show you what to do, from fantasy adventuring parties like in the _Lord of the Rings_ movies, superhero teams like _The Avengers_, and soldier groups like _G.I. Joe_. For a sense of scope, look at movies with dramatic, powerful characters with equally immense foes, like _300_ or _Beowulf_.

Everything I’ve listed has been an inspiration for this battle system. This is as much about making a comic- or movie-style battle as much as it is about incredible demigods beating the crap out of Myths.

### The Silent Foe: Time

Heroes do not just fight against Myths, they fight against time. Myths will always gain theupper hand if they are given enough time; that is their nature. Sometimes, that’s because they have some other plan, or they have reinforcements coming, or they’ll just outlast the heroes if the heroes do not give it their all and then some. Regardless, just as in action movies, Mythenders do not have the luxury of being meek and whittle down myths. If they take too long, the Myth will gain enough power to outright annihilate them.

### The Need for Power & the Risk of Corruption

Especially when fighting the greater Myths and gods, Mythenders need to tap into Mythic Power to overcome their foes. In doing so, they risk become the very thing they were forged to destroy. Every time Mythic Power is called upon, it’s like taking a wound to your soul—one you can’t feel, as you’re numb to pain in the heat of battle, so it is hard to know how deeply you’ve been cut.

Think about an epic fight in the _Star Wars_ universe, and the temptation to call upon the Dark Side to defeat one who can use that same power freely, and you understand this dilemma.

But Mythenders don’t change in the middle of the battle. They change just afterward, in that first calm moment after all is done. Only in that calm do you feel each of those cuts into your being, and only then to we see if you have taken the final wound that annihilates your mortal nature.

## Really Important Concepts

If you’re used to playing other combat-oriented roleplaying games, there are a couple big assumptions that you might have that aren’t true in <span class="mythender">Mythender</span>. Some people understand these concepts right away, and others need to see these things in action before they truly comprehend how it works.

### Actions Are About Power, Not Success & Failure

When you do an action, you will succeed. The only immediate failure in <span class="mythender">Mythender</span> is failing to keep your Mythic nature under control, and never in what you do to assault a Myth.

So why even roll dice? Because the question of each action is how much power that action will give you. Every one gives you power to wound the Myth and survive the battle.

Hurl a spear at Thor, and it will hit. How much power will it give you? What will you do with that power?

### There is No Such Thing As Defense

The adage “the best defense is a good offense” is literally true in <span class="mythender">Mythender</span>. When someone attacks you, it will connect—again, there’s no failure. Your foes gain power, just as you do. The only thing you can do to keep yourself from being killed is to kill the other guy first. There is no parrying or dodging an attack, though you’re free to describe a bit of color when an attack happens and it doesn’t kill you (which is most of the time).

It’s a race to the other’s death. You’ll get beat down at times, but if you beat down the other guy even more, then you will prevail.

### There is only One Myth in a Battle

While you might be fighting a horde of beasts, there’s only one actual Myth playsheet on the table. The Mythmaster has one set of stats representing every foe you see on the field of battle. Keeps things simple.

## Physical & Metaphysical Nature of Battle

Battles in the Mythic World take place in a space unlike battles mortal make among themselves. It is not solely about being the most badass gal with a sword or beating the other guy to the punch, though that’s certainly part of it. The Mythic World is both physical and symbolic, as are its Myths.

The same is true for Mythenders.

### Physical

This should be obvious. You can slaughter your foes with your skills, your blade, your cavalry, all that real-world stuff. Even much of magic is physical: lightning scorches your body, water drowns your lungs, etc.

### Metaphysical

Here’s where it starts to get weird, as Myths and Mythenders can assault each other’s Mythic Hearts in different ways.

#### The Near-Physical

You can assault the Mythic soul of another being with faux-physical acts, like stabbing them in their aura with a ghost knife, having spirits rend their essence, and so on. Those are metaphysical, but they appear and feel physical, so it still makes sense to new Mythenders still used to how mortals war.

#### The Connection of Weapons

Weapons are connected to the Myths and Mythenders that wield them. By assaulting a Weapon, you’re assaulting that being directly, usually through Relic and Companion Weapons. By wounding and killing Companions, you’re attacking your foe directly.

This can manifest physically. Behead a lieutenant, and watch as the Myth has a new wound around her ribs. But it need not—Wounds don’t have to show to kill.

Also, this means that parrying with your Relic Weapon is kind of ridiculous, but also still totally badass since, from a story perspective, two Weapons are assaulting each other. Sparks should fly. (That said, there’s no rules for this sort of “we hurt each other at the same time” because there’s no such thing as defense in <span class="mythender">Mythender</span>–you’ll see the rules soon enough.)

#### Assault of the Mind & Soul

Here’s where it gets strange: beings with Mythic Hearts are forces of will. By assaulting that will–making that Mythender or Myth _feel_ something they don’t want to–you’re directly wounding that Heart. Causing a moment of fear, doubt, confusion, lust, loss, sadness, dismay, anything that doesn’t come purely and naturally from your foe is in and of itself an attack. Often, these attacks can manifest physically, since the physical and the symbolic are utterly linked–fear making cracks in skin or the like–but this isn’t _always_ the case.

So, yes, if you can describe how you can pull it off with your Weapons and the situation, you _can_ stab your foe in the hope with your ennui.

Wrap your head around that one.

Or don’t. Many Mythenders stick to the realm of the physical and near-physical. Also cool.

## The Shape of Foes

Myths come in a few different shapes and sizes. Sometimes the Mythenders will face an army or horde of lesser monsters. Other times, a small group of powerful creatures or sorcerers. And always, at the end, a greater Myth or god, with its own host of lesser Myths.

### Lesser Myths

The lesser foes know they are going to their doom when facing a Mythender. Mythenders can and will easily slaughter a dozen with a single, simple blow. They throw themselves away for the glory of Mythic Norden and the masters they serve, knowing that what they’re doing is pushing the Mythenders to take on Mythic Corruption. And should they succeed in pushing long enough, some even escape with a piece of that stolen power, that their god will take advantage of later.

Because there are so many, they count as one of their own Weapons, usually a Companion Weapon (such as <span class="keyword">The Horde</span> or <span class="keyword">The Army</span>).

### Powerful Creatures & Sorcerers

These beings work in packs of three to twelve, and may have a small army of lesser Myths with them (as Companion Weapons). The fewer there are, the more powerful they tend to be. They too know that their lives are likely forfeit, but they are also more dangerous the longer they survive.

### Greater Myths & Gods

The grand myths, ancient monsters, and gods are the most powerful of Myths. Their Endings are not guaranteed, for they do not simply seek to survive a battle, but to force Mythenders to embrace Corruption to fight them. So even if they are Ended, they may be reborn from a fallen Mythender. And as they are the most powerful of all Myths, the Mythic World grants them strength throughout the battle. If they last long enough, they will have enough power to sunder the Mythenders once and for all.

### What This Means

Between these three categories, little changes within the rules. The gods have four Weapons while they others have three, just like Mythenders. Sometimes the god’s Weapon charge bonuses are different (**Charge or Drain Your Weapon**). And the powers the gods trigger each time they begin a new round increase with ferocity with their scale (**The Myth’s Tricks**).

The biggest difference, though, is in describing hurting or killing these foes. Casually describing killing a few lesser foes during an action is trivial, not even requiring Lightning Tokens to be spent. On the other hand, it takes great effort (and expenditure of Lightning) to merely wound a god. There’s more about this throughout the chapter, but you should know that going into a battle.

## Framing a Battle

Framing a battle is about describing the set where the battle’s happening, how the Mythenders and the Myth enter, any opening witty or foretelling dialogue, things like that.

The Mythmaster will paint the scene, describing the location and the creatures or gods involved. Maybe there’s some banter between the Mythenders and their foes before violence happens. Maybe not. The Mythmaster has some guidance on this in **Describe the World**, and some sample sets for Mythic Norden in **Some Battle Sets**.

Take a moment to set up the tone of this battle, like the opening shot in a movie or comic’s extended fight scene. Don’t worry about having to rush into the fight; the Myth’s going to get the first action no matter what, because they always have the home field advantage.

Once the exposition and any pre-battle dialogue feels done, the Myth starts the first round.

### The First Action

The Myth always gets the first action in a round, period. This is the advantage the Myths have because of the Mythic World’s backing, as actions aren’t just about doing something but about drawing power to slaughter your foes through what you’re doing.

That’s how the game works. Sometimes, Mythenders will describe being awesome in a way that seems like they should go first. Interrupt that. Myths are cheating assholes.

## Initial Battle Stats

When a battle starts, Mythenders and Myths set their dice and tokens:

### Mythenders

Any Thunder or Lightning you had left over from the last battle should have already been discarded. If not, discard them now. Likewise, any charge boxes that you have checked and not drained are erased, unless you preserved them after the previous battle.

Take starting Thunder based on how much Corruption you’ve gained, based on your current Form:

- <span class="keyword">Mortal Form</span>: start with 1 Thunder die
- <span class="keyword">Paragon Form</span>: start with 2 Thunder dice
- <span class="keyword">Supernatural Form</span>: start with 4 Thunder dice
- <span class="keyword">Godly Form</span>: start with 6 Thunder dice

The stronger your link to the Mythic World, the more power you command at the start.

If you had a moment to rest (i.e. had a Mythender Moment before this battle), then you may also erase the marks on the drain and charge boxes, except for those charge marks you’ve preserved after a battle (**End of the Battle**). Along with that, your Wound track should also be completely healed.

### Myths

If the Myth has any Intrinsic Weapons, they start the battle with the middle charge box charged for each one of those Weapons. If the Myth gained any additional charges based on what’s happened during the adventure up to now, charge off that many more boxes on any Weapon, at your discretion.

Myths get Storm dice, starting Thunder dice, and starting Might based on their write-up.

### Blights

Only Lasting Blights start in a battle. Any Blights that weren’t Lasting from the previous battle should already be gone. If not, remove them now. (The exception is if there was no time taken to rest between the last battle and this one.)

## Actions in Brief

In a battle, the Mythenders are trying to End a Myth (a monster or god) either before the Myth slaughters them all or builds up enough power by surviving the battle to beat them down. It consists of rounds where the Myth takes one action and then the Mythenders take one action each.

On each action, you’ll pick out a Weapon you’re using, sometimes along with a Blight, and describe the awesome thing you’re doing. Then you’ll roll your dice—your Storm dice (![ ](/catalog/creators/ryan-macklin/mythender/storm-6.svg)) and your Thunder dice (![ ](/catalog/creators/ryan-macklin/mythender/thunder-6.svg))—and count up your successes. Your Storm dice are the measure of your power in a single action, and your Thunder dice are the measure of your strength of presence in the battle. Successes on Storm dice give you more Thunder dice for the future, and successes on Thunder dice give you a new thing called Lightning Tokens.

Lightning Tokens are what you use to do permanent things like Wound the fuck out of your foe or cause a Blight that you can keep drawing power from. Wounding a Myth until it’s Ended is how the Mythenders win, and vice versa. Causing a Blight is a way for you and all your friends to gain power during a battle…which in turn will help you Wound the fuck out of creation.

Here’s the thing: when you get Wounded, you lose Thunder dice—you roll the dice and lose certain ones. If you run out, you’re Ended. So you need Thunder dice, or you’ll die.

There’s another important piece of an action: the Mythic die (![ ](/catalog/creators/ryan-macklin/mythender/mythic-6.svg)). Some actions will have you roll it, and some won’t. When you do, you’ll get great stuff for it, depending on the sort of action. But it always comes at a price of possibly losing a piece of your mortality and edge closer to dark apotheosis and becoming a hateful Myth.

Fun fact: the Mythmaster never gets to roll the Mythic die. That’s just for you, Mythenders. Power and temptation. Sweet, sexy power. Tasty, tantalizing temptation.

The rest of this chapter will go into this and a bunch more, but that’s the short of it.

## Rounds

Battles play out in rounds of action beats. During each round, everyone will get to go once.

### Myths start each round

Each round starts with the Mythmaster playing the Myth’s action beat. After that, each of the Mythenders get to go.

### Mythender turn order

Mythenders get to decide what order they go in each round. You don’t have to decide the entire lineup right away; one person can go, and based on what happens, the others can decide who’s next. Whatever order you choose for this round doesn’t impact other rounds; you freely decide each time.

If they can’t decide, then the round’s over! Naturally, the Mythmaster is encouraged to help the Mythenders decide rather than be an asshole about it.

### End of the Round

If the Myth is alive at the end, the Myth triggers that round’s Gathering Rage—some effect that happens because the Myth keeps building power from the Mythic World. Some effects are delayed, only happening once the battle is over. Some effects, and this is always the case when fighting a Greater Myth, happens right away.

There’s more about Gathering Rage at **The Myth’s Tricks**.

#### Going More Than Once a Round

There is a dirty trick that allows you to go twice in a round, a Gift called <span class="keyword">Swiftness</span>. You can find that in the Gifts chapter.

## Blights

<span class="keyword">Blights</span> are scars on the world inflicted by beings of Myth—monsters, gods, and Mythenders alike—that continue to harm those around it. Blights are fueled by the Mythic power inherent in the land, like geysers of power. Those who create blights can draw that power to fuel greater action.

Blights are impossible to create or destroy for anyone except Mythenders, Myths, and the Mythic World itself. In and out of battle, you’ll create, use, and destroy Blights.

### What Blights Do

Blights serve as a wellspring of power for Myths and Mythenders. They change the land, making it more incredible, savage, and awe-inspiring. During battle, they give you more power when you use them, and grow with each use.

### Blight Cards

Blights are written down on little <span class="keyword">Blight Cards</span>. The power charged into and drained from a Blight is recorded on the track on the righthand side.

### Creating & Destroying Blights

The rules for creating and destroying Blights during a battle can be found at **Creating a Blight**, and noted on the quick reference section on the Blight Cards. The rules for creating and destroying Blights outside of battle can be found as part of **Performing Badass, Epic Feats**.

### Fleeting, Lasting & Personal Blights

#### Fleeting Blights

Blights made during a battle are fleeting—they only have enough power in them to fuel while a battle rages around it, and then die when the battle calms. They’ll go away at the end of a battle unless someone invests power in turning it into a Lasting Blight.

#### Lasting Blights

Blights made outside battle, and those bolstered after a battle, are Lasting. They persist until someone destroys them. For those, check off the Lasting box at the top of the card.

The Mythic World may turn a Blight created during a battle into a Lasting one as a Lesser Myth dies (see **Gathering Rage**). It can do this regardless of who created the Blight. The Blight is a part of the Mythic World once it’s created, after all.

Mythenders may turn a Blight from a battle into a Lasting Blight by spending surplus Lightning tokens during a battle’s aftermath (**End of the Battle**) or doing a **Badass, Epic Feat** as your Mythender’s Moment.

#### Personal Blights

Mythenders have <span class="keyword">Personal Blights</span> as part of their Fate. These are not like true Blights, in that they aren’t special wellsprings of power that you can call on. They’re a symptom of the wellspring of power you already have from your Mythic Heart. However, you can use it to create a true Blight, by describing how you turn your Personal Blight to 11.

### Different Sorts of Blights

Blights can take many forms, so long as they change the land and those present can feel its effects. The following is by no means a comprehensive list; it’s here to give you a basic idea, so you can quickly make Blights in play. By all means, get creative!

There are no special rules for these individual types of Blights, just a way of thinking about them so you can incorporate them into your play.

#### Catastrophes

Catastrophic Blights that scar the land, sea, or air (or all three) are a very common form of Blight. Causing living fire to rage through fields, the sky to rain lightning-spears, lava bursting forth from the earth, magical whirlpools—if it’s a natural disaster that you can describe as Mythic, it’s a catastrophic Blight.

#### Entities

Summoning beings from nowhere happens often around Mythenders that claim dominion over spirits or the dead. Having nature spirits manifest and fight with you, earth spirits move the land as you desire, or the dead rising for one last go at battle—if it involves creating a new entity or entities on the battlefield, it’s this sort of Blight.

#### Auras & Impositions

Anything that makes others feel something is an imposing Blight. Auras that describe feeling revulsion, desire, fear, rage, or any other emotion or basic instinct can be a Blight.

These sorts of Blights can’t force a Mythender to do something because of an alien feeling; that’s beyond the power of the Mythic World, because Mythenders still have free will (for the time being). However, it can still wound them in battle, as battle is both physical and metaphysical. See **Physical & Metaphysical Nature of Battle**.

#### Curses

Curses are Blights that impose their will directly on mortals and the creatures of the Mythic World. Making mortals ill or have amnesia, animals feral and nigh-invulnerable, or the essence of bad luck are a few examples of curse Blights.

Like with Auras, these Blights tend to be more metaphysical in danger than physical.

### The Locality of Blights

Blights cover as much ground as makes sense, and can be accessed as long as the Blight’s effects can be felt or you can justify involving it. A Blight about ever-burning fields only exists around that field, though you can describe calling upon those fires to spread or become elemental creatures of fire. A Blight about primal thunder everywhere exists everywhere. Go with what makes sense for what you’ve described.

## Steps to Your Action

There are three overall steps to each turn: describe how you’re awesome in this moment, roll dice and gain power, and push forward with your effects.

Each of these steps are broken up into bits of decisions and actions, and are covered in detail on the following pages.

#### Form Your Action

You’ll choose the scale of your action, what Weapon you’ll use, any Blight you’ll use, and describe what you do in the battle. You’ll then charge or drain the Weapon and Blight to determine your dice for this action.

#### Describe Being Awesome

Once you know what your action consists of, you’ll describe it being totally fucking awesome.

#### Roll Dice & Gain Power

You’ll gather dice based on what you described, roll them, and then gain Thunder die, Lightning tokens and Might tokens based on that roll.

You might also check off a Corruption box and possibly a Fate box.

#### Push Forward

If you have enough Lightning tokens to cause an effect—such as wounding a foe or creating a Blight—and want to, you can spend Lightning to cause one or more and describe what happens as a result of your action. Otherwise, the Mythmaster describes the result.

Note that you can share Lightning tokens with your friends to help them pay for effects they otherwise can’t afford in that moment.

#### If This Seems Intimidating

This might seem like a lot of rules, but the core of the game’s easy to figure out—you roll a bunch of dice and pick out successes. From there, it’s about deciding what leads to rolling those dice and what you do with those successes. But it is a lot of stuff to read, because battling in <span class="mythender">Mythender</span> is about the story of your epic fights, and that takes a bit to talk about.

If you’re having some panic because there are a lot of pages in this section, don’t worry! There are quite a few little decisions that can happen during an action, but you won’t be doing all of them at once. These pages get wordy to help explain the ideas.

This chapter isn’t set up to teach you how to play. For that, check out the **Tutorial Battle** chapter. It introduces ideas slowly, and doesn’t go into every single thing you can possibly decide on. It’s built to be the first battle in a two-battle convention or single session game.

And there’s the **Battle Quick Reference** that just lists the steps in brief, with page references if you need more.

#### Use Pencil

These rules involve checking things off on your playsheet that will be erased later. So use pencil, and try to be gentle on your character sheets.

## Scales of Action

When a Mythender acts in battle, he chooses the <span class="keyword">scale</span> of that action. That scale determines how safe or risky the action is, and how much power is granted by that action.

A <span class="keyword">Legendary action</span> is safe. It doesn’t draw dangerous power from the world of Myth, so there’s no risk your mortal soul. It’s the closest that Mythenders have to a “normal” action.

When you’re describing Legendary, limit yourself to feats that are only demigodlike. Impressive acts of physical violence, stoic resolve, or vast cunning are right on-target. Minor unreal talents, like small effects of sorcery or willworking, are also within the bounds of a Legendary action. Such an action should come from a literal interpretation of one of your Weapons.

**_Example: Seeing the winged horses of the valkyrie out of reach of his sword, William kicks at a nearby tree (using his _**<span class="keyword">Strongest of my Tribe</span>**_ Weapon). It breaks at the base, and he hurls the newly felled tree at his foes._**

A <span class="keyword">Mythic action</span> is a powerful action that breaks the laws of the world. It risks corrupting your mortal soul, but with rewards of greater power. Along with your action.

When you’re describing a Mythic action, get crazy. You’re tapping into a limitless power source that merely asks you to risk your very freedom for that power. Going beyond the impossible is expected. Leap mountains. Fight in mid-air. Freeze rivers with a word. Cause your weapons to glow with malice.

These actions also stem from your Weapons, either mixed with ancient, corrupting energy, from inspiration from your Fate, or just taking a previous action and turning it to 11.

**_Example: Erik screams, picks up his war-wolf (his Weapon, _**<span class="keyword">My War-Wolf, the Son of Fenrir</span>**_), and hurls it at the dragon’s head. He and it glow with blood-red energy, and the wolf bursts into holy fire as it strikes._**

A <span class="keyword">Titanic action</span> is powerful and dramatic. It draws so much power from the world of Myth that it wounds you, even as it grants you incredible power.

When you’re describing a Titanic action, go bigger than anyone’s done in the adventure so far. This is your nuclear weapon. If you’re familiar with fighty anime or Japanese RPGs, think of Titanic actions as the ultimate move that come rocketing out of heaven. These are Big Deals. They literally and figuratively shake the earth.

Take metaphorical inspiration from your Weapons or Fate, or take a literal action to an outlandish conclusion.

**_Example: Jonah the Worthy spits at the dry earth. From that springs a geyser, flooding the plains around everyone. A hydra made purely of water bursts forth, slaughtering those in its path. Jonah mumbles words of power, controlling his water-spawn with foul magics (using his <span class="keyword">Power of the Sea</span> Weapon)._**

### These Aren’t Strict Categories

The differences between these can be fuzzy, but as you play, you’ll get a sense of what actions feel like they’re in one category or another. Don’t stress too much about these; part of the Mythmaster’s job is to help you all maintain a sense of consistency here.

## Form Your Action

Looking to be fucking metal? Here’s what you get your screaming awesome on.

### Actions in Battle

Once during each round, the Myth and each Mythender take an action. This action is often some form of attack, usually physical but sometimes metaphorical or psychological. Sometimes it’s an act where you’re posturing to gain power, like a tactical pause or taking a moment to channel great energy. Whatever it is, as long as you know how and can convince everyone else at the table that this action pushes the battle forward, it’s a valid action.

Think of actions like a camera shot or comic book panel; it’s a quick moment of badassery.

#### Exceptions to Rules

The rules for battle are set: how many Weapons you can use, what you get for the dice you roll, and so on. But every Mythender and Myth have special tricks called Gifts (in their own chapter: **Your Heart’s Gifts**) that lets them break these rules. In every case, a Gift used takes precedence over the battle rules. And unless otherwise stated, you may only used a given Gift once per _action_.

### Pick a Scale

Each action must be a Legendary, Mythic, or Titanic action (see **Scales of Action**).

Myths do not choose one of these scales. The Mythmaster may describe any scale of action they wish, but use the Legendary action rules. (There are some tricks a myth can do that Mythenders can’t, though. See **The Myth’s Tricks**.)

### Choose Your Weapon

Every action involves one of your Weapons. When you describe your action, talk about how that Weapon is integral to the action. It’ll be used in the next step, when you gather dice.

You might want to work in more than one Weapon into your description. That’s great! If you have a Companion Weapon about a warhorse and a Relic Weapon about a magical spear, tell us how you ride into battle on your horse and charge at the beast with your spear! You just need to pick one to be the focus for the action. Whichever one is more prominent in the action is the one you’ll use for these rules.

### Use a Blight (optional)

Decide whether you’ll use one of the Blights in play that your side has access to, if there are any. Describe how that works in conjunction with your action, and you’ll use it when gathering dice.

As with Weapons, you can describe more than one Blight. You can charge a second Blight on an action, but you can only benefit from one when gathering dice.

## Describe Being Awesome

Describe what your Mythender (or Myth) does, like you’d describe a really good moment in a movie or comic action scene. Work in the Weapon you chose, the Blight if you’re using one, and whatever other cool stuff you think works or this moment—what the last person did, another Weapon you have, a fun line of dialogue, etc.

Reflect the scale of this action in your description. Mythic actions should feel grander than the Legendary actions that have happened so far, and vice versa. Titanic actions should feel like the highest moments of the battle. If your description doesn’t match your choice, the Mythmaster will call you on it, requiring you to re-describe or change scale.

### Looking Forward to Your Effect

Whatever results happen when you **Push Forward** must be an natural consequence of what you’re describing now. If you want to inflict a Wound on your foe, you need to describe attacking. If you want to create or destroy a Blight, you need to describe how it happens. Your description doesn’t mean the mechanical effect will definitely happen—you will need to pay the Lightning cost—but it cannot happen if you don’t describe it now.

### Note on Attacking Weapons

If you describe attacking a foe’s Weapon—usually a Companion Weapon, but you can also describe attacking Relics or even Intrinsic Weapons—then that counts as attacking the foe directly. The power of the Mythic World means that Weapons are a part of the one wielding it, and vice versa.

However, you cannot destroy a Weapon in its entirety while the being wielding it still lives and breathes. You can slaughter some Companions, but you cannot kill the last of them. Relics chip, but do not shatter. Intrinsic Weapons feel weaker, but can still be called upon.

### When to Stop Describing

Stop just before describing how badly you hurt your foe or cause some sort of vicious Blight. The effects and consequences of your actions are done after you roll dice, when you Push Forward.

Note that you’re never just _trying_ to do something. Your action will never fail. The question is how much power you gain from it and if you can make your effect something that will last longer than a moment.

### On Revising Your Action

Once you come up with your action and start describing it, you or the Mythmaster might realize that what you’re describing is a different scale, really involves a different Weapon, doesn’t actually use the Blight you want to, etc. When this happens, take a moment to either rephrase what you’re doing to match what you picked, or change what you picked to match what you’re doing. Once they match up, you’re ready to move onto the next step.

## Charge or Drain Your Weapon

Handling raw Mythic Power is dangerous and corrupting. Weapons (and Blights) make it safer, if slower than just ripping power from the beating metaphoric heart of the Mythic World. This is done by <span class="keyword">charging and draining power</span>.

Charging and draining determines the dice you grab for this action.

### Your Weapon in Action

Each time you use a Weapon, you must decide whether you want to charge one of its boxes or drain all of the charged boxes. If a Weapon has no boxes charged, then the only choice is to charge one.

You don’t have to incorporate into your description whether you’re charging to drain your Weapon. It’s enough it make your action match the scale. Still, some people like to change up their descriptions, and that’s fantastic. Do whatever makes you comfortable or excited.

### Weapon Charge Boxes

     +3 Dice  +2 Dice  +2 Might
       ☐☐     ☐☐     ☐☐

       ☐☐     ☐☐     ☐☐

       ☐☐     ☐☐     ☐☐

The boxes to the left of your Weapons are the charge boxes. These are double boxes, with one box on the top overlapping a bottom, starred box.

Each Weapon has three columns of boxes, labeled <span class="keyword">+3 Dice</span>, <span class="keyword">+2 Dice</span>, and <span class="keyword">+2 Might</span>. (Note: gods have different boxes.)

☐☐  
When neither charge box is checked for a Weapon, that bonus is <span class="keyword">free to charge</span>.

☒☐  
When the top box is checked and the bottom is unchecked, that bonus is <span class="keyword">charged and ready to be drained</span>.

☒☒  
When both boxes are checked, that bonus is <span class="keyword">drained</span>. You may not charge or drain it again for the time being.

#### Different Bonuses

Gods may have different bonuses for their charge boxes, noted in their write-up and on their Myth sheets.

### Charging Your Weapon

    ☐☐  →  ☒☐

_charging a Weapon box_

When you charge your Weapon, put a check in one of the top charge box for that weapon. You may put it in any of the three bonuses for that weapon, though usually it makes the most sense to start with the left-most <span class="keyword">+3 Dice</span> box and go right.

If you’re using a Weapon that already has all of its top charge boxes filled, you may still use that Weapon, but you get no benefit for charging it. Which means you might want to pick another Weapon for this action, unless you’re really, really keen on that being the important part of this action’s description.

### Draining Your Weapon

    ☒☐  →  ☒☒

_draining a Weapon box_

When you drain your Weapon, you put a check in the bottom charge box in every bonus for that Weapon that are ready to be drained. If only one is ready, you drain that one. If two or three are ready, you drain all that are.

There is no partial draining. You must take all of the benefits from charged boxes.

<span class="keyword">Weapon Bonus Dice</span>: gain 3 bonus Storm dice if you drained the <span class="keyword">+3 Dice</span> box. Gain 2 bonus Storm Dice if you drained the <span class="keyword">+2 Dice</span> box. If you drained both, gain +5.

You may pay 2 Might tokens to make all of the Weapon bonus dice on this action bonus Thunder dice instead. This cost is waived if you’re draining from a Relic Weapon. Relics may freely be Storm or bonus Thunder. If you do this, _all_ of the bonus dice become bonus Thunder; you may not split them up.

<span class="keyword">Might Gained</span>: gain 2 Might tokens if you drained the <span class="keyword">+2 Might</span> box. These may be used immediately, including to turn the bonus dice from this Weapon into bonus Thunder dice. Weapons drained may be used again in battle. However, until the Mythender rests after a battle, the checked charge and drain boxes do not reset.

#### Draining Weapons & Titanic Actions

Note that you don’t roll any Storm dice on <span class="keyword">Titanic actions</span> (**Gather and Roll Your Dice**), even any bonus Storm dice gained by draining Weapons and charging Blights. If you turn these bonus dice into Thunder dice, you may use them normally.

### The Weapon Types

The three Weapon types have different rules, triggered at different parts of battle.

<span class="keyword">Intrinsic Weapons</span> retain any undrained charge boxes for free when a battle is over. Other Weapons require you to pay Might for them if you wish to retain those charges. (See **Resting, Weapon Charges & Wounds**)

For Myths, the middle charge box for each <span class="keyword">Intrinsic Weapon</span> is checked at the start of the battle.

Bonus dice from <span class="keyword">Relic Weapons</span> may become Thunder dice for free. You must pay 2 Might tokens for the others.

<span class="keyword">Companion Weapons</span> gain a free charge when you’re Wounded.

## Charge or Drain a Blight

As with Weapons, when you use a Blight in battle, you decide whether you’ll charge or drain it. Blights work a bit differently than Weapons, partly because you as a group share the charges on a Blight and can work together to make a powerful Blight that one of you can drain in a crucial moment.

Charging and draining determines additional dice you grab for this action. You may only use a Blight created by your side; a Mythender cannot charge a Blight made by a Myth, and vice versa.

### This Blight in Action

Each time you use a Blight, you must decide whether you want to charge one of its boxes or drain all of the charged boxes. If a Blight has no boxes charged, then the only choice is to charge one. (When a Blight is created, it starts with at least one charge box checked. The only way it will have no boxes checked is if it was just drained.)

As with Weapons, you don’t have to incorporate into your description whether you’re charging to drain your Blight. It’s enough it make your action match the scale. Still, some people like to change up their descriptions, and that’s fantastic. Do whatever makes you comfortable or excited.

### Blight Charge Boxes

    Charges: ☒▸☐▸☐▸☐▸☐

Blight charge boxes are simpler than Weapons. There’s a track of five single boxes, without any individual labels like what Weapons have. (Unlike when you drain a Weapon, you don’t need to keep track of drained Blight charge boxes, so you just erase them when they’re drained.)

### Charging This Blight

    Charges: ☒▸☐▸☐▸☐▸☐    →    Charges: ☒▸☒▸☐▸☐▸☐

_charging the second box_

When you charge the Blight, check the top-most unchecked box.

Mythenders will only charge one box. Myths will charge as many boxes as there are Mythenders they are currently facing. So if there are three Mythenders, the Myth will check three boxes off. If there are more Mythenders than there are boxes to check off, then the Myth only checks off the remaining boxes.

<span class="keyword">Blight Bonus Dice</span>: gain one bonus Storm die this action for charging a Blight. A Myth only ever gets 1 Storm die, regardless of how many boxes it checked off.

If all of the boxes on this Blight are already checked, you still gain the bonus die for using this Blight, but there are no other benefits. It’s probably better to use a different Blight, if one exists and is available to you, or drain this one.

#### Charging Blights & Titanic Actions

Note that you don’t roll any Storm dice on <span class="keyword">Titanic actions</span> (**Your Heart’s Gifts**), even the bonus Storm die gained by charging Blights. However, you still may want to charge a Blight, so that you can drain on a later action.

You can use the Thunder dice gained for draining a Blight (see below) on Titanic actions without any penalty.

### Draining This Blight

    Charges: ☒▸☒▸☒▸☒▸☒    →    Charges: ☐▸☐▸☐▸☐▸☐

_draining all five boxes_

When you drain this Blight, note how many charges is has, then erase them all.

There is no partial draining. You must drain all of this Blight’s boxes.

<span class="keyword">Blight Bonus Dice</span>: gain bonus Thunder dice equal to the number of charged boxes were just on this Blight.

Even though the Blight’s accumulated power is entirely drained, it still exists and can be charged in future actions. However, it’s also vulnerable to being destroyed (**Destroying a Blight**): it costs nothing for a Myth or Mythender to, as part of an action, destroy a non-Lasting Blight that has no charges.

### Charging a Second Blight

You may incorporate a second Blight into your description, if one is available. You may charge that Blight, but you do not get any bonus dice from it.

You may not drain more than one Blight during an action.

## Gather & Roll Your Dice

Once you’ve charged or drained your Weapons and any Blights, time to roll those bones!

### Gather Your Dice

Legendary and Mythic actions are mostly the same. The only difference is that you also use the Mythic die for Mythic actions. Titanic actions are quite different; they still use most of the same dice pools, but do different things with the result.

#### Legendary Actions

Grab your base Storm dice and your current Thunder dice. Add in any bonus dice from your Weapon and Blight. Make sure you’ve checked the charge or drain boxes on the Weapon and Blight. Take note of any Gifts that may give you additional dice, notably <span class="keyword">Harbinger of Storm</span>.

#### Mythic Actions

Follow everything for Legendary actions. Then grab the Mythic die and progress your Corruption track by one (see **Suffer Corruption & Risk Fate**). If progressing your Corruption track causes you to change form, you should add that into your description.

#### Titanic Actions

Do not grab any Storm dice at all, regardless of any Weapon or Blight bonus dice or Gifts. Grab your current Thunder dice, as well as any bonus Thunder Dice from your draining your Weapon or Blight. Take note of any Gifts that may give you additional dice.

Then grab the Mythic die and progress your Corruption track by one. As with Mythic actions, if progressing your Corruption track causes you to change form, you should add that into your description.

### Roll All Those Dice! (Legendary & Mythic Actions)

Since Legendary and Mythic actions are very similar, their die-rolling is described together.

#### Gain Lightning from Thunder Dice

Each Thunder die that succeeds (comes up ![4](/catalog/creators/ryan-macklin/mythender/thunder-4.svg), ![5](/catalog/creators/ryan-macklin/mythender/thunder-5.svg), and ![6](/catalog/creators/ryan-macklin/mythender/thunder-6.svg)) gives you 1 Lightning token.

#### Gain Thunder from Storm Dice

Each Storm die that succeeds (comes up ![4](/catalog/creators/ryan-macklin/mythender/storm-4.svg), ![5](/catalog/creators/ryan-macklin/mythender/storm-5.svg), and ![6](/catalog/creators/ryan-macklin/mythender/storm-6.svg)) gives you 1 Thunder die.

#### Gain Thunder from the Mythic Die (Mythic Actions)

Gain additional Thunder dice equal to the number on the Mythic die (![1](/catalog/creators/ryan-macklin/mythender/mythic-1.svg) = 1 Thunder die, ![5](/catalog/creators/ryan-macklin/mythender/mythic-5.svg) = 5 Thunder dice, etc.). Then deal with **Suffer Corruption & Risk Fate**, since you rolled the Mythic die.

#### Collect your Pools

Discard all bonus dice rolled. Then take all the Thunder dice you’ve rolled and earned this action and return them to your Thunder pool. Add the Lightning you’ve collected this turn to your Lightning pool.

### Roll All Those Dice! (Titanic Actions)

#### Gain Lightning from Thunder Dice

Each Thunder die that succeeds (comes up ![4](/catalog/creators/ryan-macklin/mythender/thunder-4.svg), ![5](/catalog/creators/ryan-macklin/mythender/thunder-5.svg), and ![6](/catalog/creators/ryan-macklin/mythender/thunder-6.svg)) gives you _3_ Lightning tokens, not just 1.

Each Thunder die that fails (comes up ![1](/catalog/creators/ryan-macklin/mythender/thunder-1.svg), ![2](/catalog/creators/ryan-macklin/mythender/thunder-2.svg), and ![3](/catalog/creators/ryan-macklin/mythender/thunder-3.svg)) is immediately discarded. Titanic actions are dangerous, as Thunder is lost. If all of your dice came up failures, then at the end of this action, you have died. _You still get to finish your action, though!_ After (or as part of) Pushing Forward, go to **Mythender Death & Making the Choice**.

#### Gain Might from the Mythic Die

Gain additional Might tokens equal to the number on the Mythic die (![1](/catalog/creators/ryan-macklin/mythender/mythic-1.svg) = 1 Might token, ![5](/catalog/creators/ryan-macklin/mythender/mythic-5.svg) = 5 Might tokens, etc.). Then deal with **Suffer Corruption & Risk Fate**, since you rolled the Mythic die.

#### Collect your Pools

Discard any bonus dice rolled. Then take all the Thunder dice you haven’t lost during this action and return them to your Thunder pool. Add the Lightning you’ve collected this turn to your Lightning pool. Add the Might to your Might pool. You may also spend the Might immediately on any result-modifying Gifts.

### If You Gained Nothing

If you did a Legendary action and gained no Thunder or Lightning due to this roll, that means the action has succeeded, but the Mythic World is resisting you. You may spend 1 Might token to reroll all your Storm and Thunder dice and take that result instead.

If this second roll gains you nothing, you may claim either 1 Thunder die or 1 Lightning token. In any case, this option only exists on rolls where you gained nothing; for rerolling at other times, look at the <span class="keyword">Relentlessness</span> Gift (**Your Heart’s Gifts**).

### Using Gifts During Rolls

As long as you can pay the Might cost, you may use whatever Gifts you have on this roll that modify your dice or the result. Keep in mind that you may only use a Gift once per round.

If you gained a Gift just now thanks to rolling the Mythic die and progressing your Fate, you may use that Gift immediately if it applies, either affecting the results of the roll or using it with an effect you cause this action when you **Push Forward**.

In the rare instance that a Gift tells you that you must use it, you don’t have the option. This is the case with the <span class="keyword">Blaze of Glory</span> Gift (**Your Heart’s Gifts**), that has you roll two Mythic dice and add them together as your Mythic die result.

**Note**: no Gift allows you to reroll the Mythic die. Ever. It always stands as rolled.

## Suffer Corruption & Risk Fate

_If you rolled the Mythic die_, there are a couple more things you have to do on your playsheet: progress your Corruption track before you roll and possibly progress your Fate track after you roll.

If you didn’t roll the Mythic die (or you’re the Mythmaster, who never rolls the Mythic die), ignore this entire section. No Corruption for you this time!

### Before you Roll: Suffer Corruption

    → ☐ 4 → ☐ 4      →    → ☒ 4 → ☐ 4

_checking first Corruption box_

This is talked about in more detail on **Suffering Corruption**, but the process is repeated here briefly.

When you gain Corruption, you check off the first available Corruption box, starting with the top-left 4. Follow the arrows for further Corruption. If all of the boxes are already filled in, you don’t need to check anything.

#### If you fill in a Corruption row

    → ☒ 4 → ☐ 4      →    → ☒ 4 → ☒ 4

_checking second Corruption box, transforming into Paragon Form_

If you fill in a row, you transform: filling in your second box turns you into your Paragon Form, filling in your fourth box turns you into you Supernatural Form, and filling in your final box turns you into your Godly Form.

If you transform, work that transformation into your description (since you know you’ll change form because you know you’re grabbing the Mythic die and will gain Corruption that causes the change), or you can work that into the action’s aftermath when you **Push Forward**.

### After you Roll: Check for Fate

After you’ve rolled your dice, in addition to everything else you get, you’ll compare the number on the Mythic die with the Corruption number you just checked (the number next to that box, either 4, 3, or 2). If you already had all of the boxes checked, your Corruption number is 2.

(If you have the <span class="keyword">Blaze of Glory</span> Gift, both dice added together count as the number on the Mythic die. Which means you’re almost guaranteed to progress your Fate.)

If the Mythic die is _equal to or higher than_ the Corruption number, then you’ve lost a piece of your mortality. Congratulations! You embrace more of your Mythic nature, and get a Gift! Check off the top-most unchecked Fate box.

Otherwise, you hold onto your mortality. Don’t check off a Fate box.

#### Choosing to Embrace Fate

If the Mythic die was less than your Corruption number, but you really, really want to lose more of your mortality—maybe you need a new Gift, or maybe you just want on the fast track to being as asshole god—you can choose to give up a piece of your soul and check off a Fate box anyway. After all, you’re a Mythender. Who are we to stop you from embracing your Mythic Fate?

This doesn’t change the number on the die or any Thunder or Might you gained from the Mythic Die, just makes it so that you give up a piece of yourself.

#### If you checked off Fate box with an Apotheosis number

    ☒ 6

If you checked off a Fate box with an <span class="keyword">Apotheosis number</span> next to it, that means that at the end of this battle, if you are still standing, you’ll check to see if you become a Myth. See **Becoming a Myth**.

#### If you don’t have any Fate boxes to check off

If you’re out of unchecked Fate boxes, for one, you’re pretty much fucked at the end of this Battle. It’s unlikely you’ll come out of it still mortal.

Your Mythic Heart cannot sustain any more Gifts. You may gain one temporarily, but it goes away at the end of your action.

### Gaining Gifts

    Fate GIFTS         Might Cost
     X • Bloodlust         2
     ☒ • Grievous Harm     2

If you checked off any Fate boxes, then you gain Gifts! Each blank Gift slot next to a checked Fate box is available for placing a new Gift. Write the name of the Gift and its Might cost in the boxes to the right of the Fate box.

When you have a Gift slot open, you may pick a new Gift or upgrade an existing Gift you have. _You may do this at any time, not just right this moment_. If you choose one right now, you may immediately take benefit from it (if you pay the Might cost) before you Push Forward.

Read the **Your Heart’s Gifts** chapter for more information, as well as the list of Gifts and upgrades you may choose from.

## Push Forward

The last part of your action, after describing what you’re doing, rolling dice for it, getting stuff, and suffering Corruption, is wrapping it up by saying what happens because of your action. This is <span class="keyword">Pushing Forward</span>. The two things you’ll do is cause any effects and then describe the aftermath of your action.

### Cause Effects

With the Lightning Tokens you already possessed at the beginning of this action and those
you just gained, you may cause these effects:

- **Create a Blight**
- **Destroy a Blight**
- **Wound Your Foe**

Some Gifts may also give other options for effects.

You may cause more than one effect, though you cannot cause the same one more than once on a given action (e.g. you can’t Wound twice in one action).

#### Sharing Lightning

Mythenders have the advantage of numbers. You may ask for help from others to cover the costs of causing effects, but only if you cannot afford it all. You must pay for at least half of the total cost during this action, and you can only take Lightning from others if you need it cover to cost. This is not compulsory; others may choose to or not to volunteer Lightning.

### Describe the Action’s Aftermath

The guidance here is pretty much the same as in describing the action in the first place. Be awesome. Whatever action was done actually happens—there’s no trying in <span class="mythender">Mythender</span>. And above all, make sure it feels like it makes sense to everyone else at the table, whatever “makes sense” means to you all in this moment.

#### Who Describes The Effect

If the Mythender did not cause any effects on this action, then the Mythmaster describes the aftermath of this moment.

If the Mythender did cause even one effect, then the Mythmaster shuts up and that player gets to sell his own action, describing the aftermath and effect created.

The Mythmaster always describes the Myth’s aftermath.

#### Mythmasters Describing a Mythender’s Aftermath

When a Mythmaster describes a Mythender’s aftermath, he _will_ describe the awesome thing that happens because of the action (and may choose to invite the player to add to it). He _will_ sell the success, even though the effect is fleeting. The Mythender didn’t screw up or fail, he just didn’t put all of his juice into the moment.

If you really want to describe your own aftermath, cause an effect. _Description is for closers!_

#### Describing a Fleeting Aftermath

If an effect wasn’t caused, then the action’s aftermath is <span class="keyword">fleeting</span>. The action is still successful—actions always are in battle—but it doesn’t last. Your blow connects and the foe is knocked back or suffers a wound that shows, but doesn’t kill. Your threats and posturing causes some of the horde to flee, but still so many more remain. Your magics flash and draw power, but don’t last against the Mythic World’s raw will.

Again, Mythmasters always describe fleeting aftermaths, no matter whose action it is.

If you’re fighting against a large horde of monsters or a Mythender’s vast army, feel free to casually describe killing a few people. That’s the equivalent of a central threat getting a flesh wound. As long as it doesn’t seriously change the way the army or horde would look in a camera shot, it works. Don’t describe killing a mass of them in a fleeting action.

If you’re attacking a Weapon, remember that you cannot destroy it in its entirety.

#### Describing a Lasting Aftermath

If you caused one or more effects, then the action’s aftermath is <span class="keyword">lasting</span>. Your sword bites deep into the Myth’s neck, blood spattering across the battlefield. The spirits you conjured swirl around and torment your foes, remaining to aid your cohorts as well. The lightning the Myth called down from the sky ceases as you cause the clouds to know fear and rout.

Again, Mythmasters describe the Myth’s effects and aftermath, and the players describe their own Mythenders’ effects.

If you’re fighting against a large horde or army, get a bit crazy. Slaughter a whole mess of people. You cannot change the nature of a Weapon; if it’s <span class="keyword">My Army of Mourning</span>, you can’t make it less than an army. But still, make it brutal. If you’re fighting against a horde directly, you can carve away a good number of them, as long as there are enough left to continue battle.

#### Describing a Battle’s End

If your action caused the battle to End, then your aftermath is about the killing blow. Don’t hold back. Nothing is safe.

## Creating a Blight

To create a Blight, pay <span class="keyword">2 Lightning tokens</span>. Then grab a new Blight card and write the description of the Blight and your name on it. It starts with its first charge box checked.

As always, the Blight you make must be related to the action you described.

> **BLIGHT** ☐ Lasting
>
> Description: The ground continuously spews magma—melting the snow, charring the earth, setting trees aflame
>
> Created by: Rashid
>
> Charges: ☒▸☐▸☐▸☐▸☐

Whenever creating a new Blight, grab a fresh Blight Card. Fill it out with a flavorful description of what’s going on. Include the name of who created it and check the first charge box off.

If it’s a Lasting Blight, check off the Lasting box. Otherwise, leave it unchecked (though it may be checked later if it’s made into a Lasting Blight).

### Mirrored Blights

If you want to tap into the same Blight that the other side has created, describe your action as channeling it somehow, and you can create a Blight that has the same name. This represents you tapping into the same sense of power that your foe; however, they aren’t linked beyond that. The charge boxes are separate for each side. Your new mirrored Blight starts as all Blights do, at one charge box checked.

If one is destroyed, the other remains; you’re just destroying the link the other side has to this Blight.

If you mirror a Lasting Blight, your mirror of that isn’t automatically Lasting. You need to make it Lasting through the normal way of pouring Lightning tokens into it after a battle or performing a **Badass, Epic Feat**.

## Destroying a Blight

To destroy a Blight that isn’t Lasting, pay <span class="keyword">3 Lightning tokens per charge</span>. If one charge box is checked, the cost is 3 Lightning tokens. If two, 6 Lightning tokens, and so on. For Blights that have just been drained and left with no charge boxes checked, destroying it is free.

If the Blight is Lasting, destroying it in Battle is more costly: <span class="keyword">6 Lightning tokens per charge</span>. Should a Lasting Blight have no charges, it still costs 6 Lightning tokens to destroy.

When you destroy a Blight, _rip the card up_.

### Destroyed Blights Don’t Come Back

That Blight can never be created again during this adventure, by any side.

If you destroy one of two mirrored Blights, the other side cannot re-make that Blight, even if the other one is still around.

## Wounding your Foe

    Your Wound Cost: 3

When you cause a <span class="keyword">Wound</span>, you target one foe and hurt them in a way that can’t just be shrugged off. They then roll to see how much power that wound cost them, before you describe your action’s aftermath.

### Causing the Wound

To Wound a foe, spend Lightning tokens equal to that foe’s <span class="keyword">Wound cost</span>. A Myth’s wound cost is listed on its sheet, at least 3 and sometimes as high as 8. A Mythender’s wound cost is always 3.

#### Wounding Someone Who Has Not Acted Yet

If you choose to Wound someone who has not yet acted in this battle, they are not yet exposed fully to you. Their Wound cost is three times what it would otherwise be. (This makes it nearly impossible to slaughter anyone, Mythender or Myth, before they get a chance to go.)

_out of Wound boxes to check_

From here, the Wounded foe handles everything. First, he’ll mark the top-most unmarked box. For Mythenders, that’s the <span class="keyword">3 Wound box</span>. If that’s marked, the <span class="keyword">4 Wound box</span>. Then the <span class="keyword">5 Wound box</span>. If everything’s already marked, then do not put a new mark; treat it as if you marked the <span class="keyword">6 Wound box</span>.

Whatever box is marked gives you your <span class="keyword">Wound number</span>. If you couldn’t mark a box, then your wound number is 6.

Some Myths have different tracks than Mythenders do. Shown here are what Mythenders suffer, but the process is the same for Myths.

### Roll Your Thunder Pool

Once you have your Wound number, roll all of your Thunder Dice. Any that come up less than your Wound number are immediately discarded. Keep those that are equal or higher than your Wound number.

#### Wound Numbers Higher Than 6

Sometimes, thanks to Gifts (like <span class="keyword">Grievous Harm</span>, **Your Heart’s Gifts**) or doubling down (below), you’ll end up with a Wound number higher than 6. Since you’re rolling six-diced dice, there’s no number higher than 6 on them! That means you do something a little different.

First, you roll all your Thunder Dice, and discard anything less than 6. After that, if your Wound number is 7, then you’ll discard one of the ![6](/catalog/creators/ryan-macklin/mythender/thunder-6.svg)s you rolled, if any. If your Wound number is 8 or higher, you’ll discard two ![6](/catalog/creators/ryan-macklin/mythender/thunder-6.svg)s, if any rolled.

This tends to cause someone to die.

### If You Have Thunder Dice Left

Congratulations! You aren’t dead…yet.

When the aftermath is described, you might want to work into your description the amount of Thunder dice lost— when your foe had fifteen dice, losing two looks and feels different than losing ten. You don’t have to work that in: only if you’re inspired.

Just remember that you aren’t out of the fight, at least not yet. There are always tricks to build up your Thunder pool quickly, at risks and costs.

#### If You Lost No Thunder Dice

This is the best possible result! But keep in mind that you’ve still been Wounded, and that the next Wound is more likely to hurt you further. You didn’t get away clean; it just didn’t slow you down.

Do not expect such treatment the next time.

### If You Have No Thunder Dice Left

Well, fuck. You’re dead. And if you’re the last one left on your side (or the only one, in the case of Myths), the others have won. Go to **End of the Battle**.

Unless you’re a Mythender. Mythenders are bastards that can choose to come back from death, by taking on more Corruption. See **Mythender Death & Making the Choice**.

### Special Notes

#### Doubling Down

You can only inflict one Wound on a given foe per action, but you can pay more to increase its power. If you spend double your foe’s Wound cost, then its Wound number for this roll is increased by one. This doesn’t change which Wound box is checked, just the Wound number.

You may increase the Wound number further, for a total of two higher, by paying quadruple the Lightning cost. You cannot increase any more than that through spending Lightning.

#### Resisting Doubling Down & Grievous Harm (Myths Only)

If you’re being Wounded and your foe doubles down or uses <span class="keyword">Grievous Harm</span> Gift to increase your Wound number, you can reduce it back down to the original number by spending your own Lightning. You can pay your Wound cost to reduce it down by 1, and double your Wound cost to reduce it by 2. If your Wound number is raised higher than that, you cannot reduce it further.

When you are doing this, you aren’t defending yourself from a blow or anything like that. Instead, you’re drawing from the Mythic World to heal your wounds with haste and give you a moment of reprieve. The other side still gets to describe this Wound you suffer.

Also, you cannot lower your Wound number to less than what it is on the Wound box you just checked off.

#### Spreading the Pain (Myths Only)

Myths have tricks for Wounding more than one Mythender in **The Myth’s Tricks**.

## Mythender Death & Making the Choice

Mythenders aren’t easily killed! Whenever a Mythender runs out of Thunder dice, whether due to being Wounded or a Titanic action, he has a choice: to die as a mortal, or to survive by taking in even more Corruption and permanently edging closer to Fate.

If you die, your Mythender’s story ends right then and there—a heroic death. If you survive, pulling on the Mythic power to overcome death leaves a permanent scar upon your mortality. This does not apply to **Murdering Another Mythender**. Those deaths always hold.

### The Mortal Choice to Die

If you wish to retain your mortality, you can embrace this killing wound as a mortal and die. Your character’s story is over, dying a hero rather than living long enough to be corrupted by the Mythic World.

Immediately describe the death scene; this is your Mythender’s final moment, go out with glory. You can ask others to give you ideas, but no matter what, this is your moment.

If your Mythender has any Lightning tokens at this moment, you may include in your death one last act to help someone else out, and give one other Mythender your Lightning.

### The Mythic Choice to Survive

If you wish to continue the fight, you can embrace your Fate and shrug off this Wound. This corrupts you further, and being Wounded so devastatingly dents your momentum. Describe how your Mythic nature keeps you from a Wound that would kill a lesser being.

You may choose to narrate coming back either right away or on your next turn. Any Lightning tokens you had or gained remain with you (contrary to prior versions these rules).

#### Progressing Corruption & Fate

Advance your Corruption by one. Advance your Fate by one and gain a Gift. See **Suffer Corruption & Risk Fate** for those processes. Then you’ll mark permanent Corruption and Fate, as per **Permanent Corruption & Fate**.

#### Getting Back Into the Battle

Either immediately after your death, at any point in the Mythenders’ turn, or (if you haven’t done so by that point) at the end of the battle, you may narrate either how you narrowly escaped death or even how you in fact did die and just came back to life. If you haven’t taken an action this round and it’s a legitimate moment for you to do so, get your vengeance on!

Once you’re back in the battle, gain Thunder dice based on the starting Thunder rules (1 Thunder die if you’re in your Mortal form, 2 in Paragon, 4 in Supernatural, and 6 in Godly).

## Myth Death & Being Screwed

When a Myth loses all its Thunder Dice, it’s dead. Ended. The battle’s over.

Some gods have the power to overcome this once, if they can pay the toll. But even among
gods is that a rare thing. (See the <span class="keyword">One More Breath</span> Gift, **Your Heart’s Gifts**.)

That’s it. Move onto **End of the Battle**.

Note: the tutorial battle has a special Gift built in, <span class="keyword">Practice Death</span>, so that every Mythender gets to have a three actions. See the write-up for the einjerhar in **Mythic Norden** for more details.

## End of the Battle

There is only one way a battle will end: when one side is dead.

### All the Mythenders Die

If all the Mythenders die, either because of choosing to die, because of **Gathering Rage**, or because battle paused due to **Murdering Another Mythender** and they all died, the battle is naturally over.

Everyone collaborates to describe how the Myth wins and how the Mythenders die. The adventure is now over—though it’s an opportunity to create new Mythenders based on this event (**When Mythenders Die & Fall**) and have them continue this quest. That, however, is a whole new adventure.

### The Myth is Ended

When a Myth runs out of Thunder dice, it is defeated and Ended!

#### The Fall of Mythenders

Before describing the End, check to see if any Mythenders fall. This is covered in **Becoming a Myth**.

You may have the idea of Murdering Another Mythender in order to keep him from falling, but the moment the Myth is ended, this is checked. You already had your chance to Murder before now. This is the one thing that Murder cannot interrupt.

#### Describing the End

Everyone collaborates, even those who died in this battle, to describe some bit about how the Ending happens, starting with the Mythender who did the killing blow. How did your foe finally go down? What happened with the corpse, if any? What about the surrounding landscape and all the calamities that have happened?

If any Mythenders became Myths, include that in the description. Remember, they will be taken away by the Mythic World and unable to be Ended right at this moment.

#### Aftermath Effects

The Mythmaster will apply any aftermath effects from Gathering Rage (**The Myth’s Tricks**), and describe how those come into play.

#### The End of a God

If this is the End of this adventure’s god or greater Myth, the adventure is over. Everyone shares in describing how the world is changed because of this, whether they lived, died, or fell. This is the adventure’s dénouement; relish it!

#### Discard Thunder & Lightning

When a battle is over, discard your Thunder and Lightning. Hang onto the Might you have.

### Converting Blights into Lasting Blights

Sometimes, a Mythmaster may be able to turn a Blight made in the battle into a Lasting Blight. Doing so just means taking the Blight, regardless of who owns it, and claiming it for the Mythic World. Rewrite the name on the Blight (if need be) and check the Lasting box.

Mythenders may also do this, claiming a Blight as a Lasting Blight or creating a new Lasting Blight from nothing. If the Mythenders collectively have 15 Lightning left over, they may turn an existing Blight into a Lasting one that one of them owns, regardless of who did before. Or, with 20 Lightning, they may created a new Lasting Blight.

If you don’t have enough Lightning, you can count every 2 Thunder dice you collectively have as 1 Lightning token for this purpose.

The Mythmaster will claim a Blight first, if he has the option. Blights that are already Lasting cannot be claimed by another.

When turning a Blight Lasting, feel free to reword it, describing how the Blight’s shifted after the moment of battle is over. A Blight like “The blue flames bursting forth from the lost souls” could turn into “The Plains of Suffering”, making a moment in a battle become an iconic scar on the world.

### Gaining More Might

If, after paying for any Lasting Blights, the group collectively has at least 20 Lightning left, every Mythender gains 2 Might tokens. This new Might can, of course, be used to keep Weapon charges upon resting (below).

Again, if you don’t have enough Lightning, you can use Thunder dice as above.

### Resting, Weapon Charges & Wounds

This happens during the Mythenders’ time, but once the Mythenders have a moment to rest, all checked Weapon charge and drain boxes are erased. In addition, you fully heal; all checks on Wound boxes are erased.

#### Holding Onto Undrained Charges

If you have Weapons with undrained charges, they go away when you rest unless you expend energy and effort to retain them. This is all a part of your Mythic Heart calming down outside of battle. You may keep an undrained charge box by paying <span class="keyword">1 Might token</span>; you may do this for any and all undrained charges you have.

<span class="keyword">Intrinsic Weapons</span> keep charges for free. Your Relics may be (at least metaphorically) sheathed and your Companions may catch their breath, but those talents and emotions within never calm down.

Note: this must be paid every time you rest after battle. If you charge a Weapon during one battle and don’t drain it on your next battle, it must be paid for again to retain that charge.

## The Myth’s Tricks

The Myths have a few tricks they can pull off that Mythenders can’t.

### Mixing Weapon Types

Some powerful Myths have <span class="keyword">Greater Weapons</span> that count as two types: <span class="keyword">Intrinsic/Relic</span>, <span class="keyword">Intrinsic/Companion</span>, or <span class="keyword">Relic/Companion</span>. These Weapons get the benefits of both types. (More on Greater Weapons in the Extended Rules, **Gaining Greater Weapons**.)

### Recharging Might

    Might Recharge: 2

At the beginning of each round after the first, the Myth gains more Might. Each one has a <span class="keyword">Might Recharge</span> stat.

**_Example: the einherjar (Mythic Norden) have a Might Recharge of 2. They start a turn with 1 Might, which means they gain 2 more Might, for a total of 3._**

### Wounding More Than One Mythender

Myths face multiple Mythenders, and as long as the description of the action can apply to Wounding more that one, it can.

Pay for the first Mythender normally. For each additional Mythender, you may pay their Wound Cost or spend 1 Might token in place of that Wound cost.

If you do anything to increase the Wound number, either doubling down or using the Grievous Harm gift, you must pay those costs individually. For doubling down, that must still be done with Lightning tokens; Might cannot be used in place for that, though you can use Might to cover the first part of the cost.

**_Example: Jörmungandr’s (Mythic Norden) blood poisons the land and strikes the three Mythenders it’s facing. It has 10 Lightning tokens and 18 Might tokens. It spends 3 Lightning to Wound the first Mythender and pays 2 Might tokens to Wound the other two. The Mythmaster wants to bring the pain, so he spends 6 more Lightning to double down: 3 for the first Mythender, and 3 for the second one. The third Mythender only has to roll normally for a Wound._**

### Gathering Rage

Myths gain power during a battle. At the end of each round it’s still alive, an effect is triggered. Some effects take place immediately, and some happen as the aftermath, at the end of the battle. The effects for each round are listed as part of the Myth.

This effect is at the end of the round, thus it happens before the Myth’s next turn. Sometimes, a round won’t have a Gathering Rage effect associated with it.

#### Immediate Effects

- <span class="keyword">Gain X Thunder/Lightning/Might.</span> If Thunder is gained, they’re real Thunder dice, held on until the Myth is Wounded, as normal.
- <span class="keyword">Create or Charge a Blight.</span> If charging a Blight, it’s charged normally; one box for each Mythender the Myth is fighting.
- <span class="keyword">Push Mythender Corruption.</span> The Myth forces the Mythenders to push their Corruption (not Fate) by one. This costs 1 Might token per Mythender to activate.
- <span class="keyword">End battle on its terms</span> The Myth decides if it gets to flee or die, right now. The Mythenders have lost this battle, even if the Myth decides to die, because the Greater Myth of this adventure checks one more Weapon charge box.
- <span class="keyword">Charge a Weapon.</span> The Myth gets to charge any Weapon charge box. The effect may specify more than one charge.
- <span class="keyword">Sunder a Weapon.</span> The Myth may now sunder a Weapon (see below) on a future action. This can only be done once this battle.
- <span class="keyword">Wound the Mythenders.</span> The Myth immediately gets to Wound the Mythenders just by still being present. It costs 1 Might token per Mythender to activate, and the Wound number cannot be increased in any way. The Myth doesn’t have to target every Mythender.
- <span class="keyword">End the Mythenders.</span> The Myth has gained enough power to slaughter outright the Mythenders. The Mythenders lose, and there’s no coming back from this death. Only the greater Myths and gods have this ability.

#### Aftermath Effects

- <span class="keyword">Create a Lasting Blight.</span> Either take one of the Blights created in this battle, by any side, and turn it into a Lasting Blight for the Myth; or make a new Blight based on what happened in the battle.
- <span class="keyword">Give the God a Charge/Thunder/Lightning/Might.</span> The Greater Myth the Mythenders will eventually fight will become stronger because of the energy gained in this moment. It may give an additional Weapon charge, Thunder for its pool, starting Lightning (in which case, it will start with some Lightning in its battle), or Might.

### Sundering Weapons

A Gathering Rage trigger may allow a Myth to sunder one of its own Weapons for a quick boost of power. This is a different Weapon option beyond charging and draining. When a Myth sunders a Weapon, it destroys it—cross it off the sheet. It’s no longer available.

The rewards for sundering a Weapon depends on how much power was already poured into it through charges. The rewards are either extra Thunder dice _to be rolled this turn_ (not bonus Thunder dice, actual Thunder dice), extra Lightning tokens, or more Might tokens.

- If the Weapon has <span class="keyword">no charges</span>: 4 Thunder, 5 Lightning, or 2 Might
- If the Weapon has <span class="keyword">one charge</span>: 6 Thunder, 10 Lightning, or 4 Might
- If the Weapon has <span class="keyword">two charges</span>: 8 Thunder, 15 Lightning, or 6 Might
- If the Weapon has <span class="keyword">all three charges</span>: 10 Thunder, 20 Lightning, or 8 Might

No mixing; you take either all Thunder dice, Lightning tokens, or Might tokens. The Myth _may also_ charge or drain another Weapon this turn. So this isn’t a small boost. When doing this, describe how the Myth destroys the Weapon horrifically and irrevocably.

**_Example: Odin (Mythic Norden) decides to sunder his_** <span class="keyword">Wolves, Geri and Freki</span>**_. They have one charge. He uses his_** <span class="keyword">Spear, Gungnir</span> **_to skewer them, cut them open, and flinging the entrails onto the Mythenders. The Mythmaster takes the 6 Thunder dice, and rolls them along with the rest of the dice. He crosses off_** <span class="keyword">Geri and Freki</span> **_and gets to check off charging_** <span class="keyword">Gungnir</span>**_. The dice he gained are normal Thunder dice, so he’ll be keeping them until he’s Wounded._**

## Basic Battle Tactics

### Build up Thunder

Building your Thunder pool is how you get more Lightning tokens and remain alive in battle. And it makes how you use the bonus dice from Weapons tactically important. Sometimes, you’ll need that to be bonus Storm dice in order to build up your Thunder pool, especially if you think that the Myth will be alive for another round. Other times—especially when you want to bring a vicious Wound on a god—it’s worth making the bonus dice Thunder instead for a potential boost of Lightning tokens.

So just because you can make your Weapon bonus dice as Thunder doesn’t mean it’s always the best tactic. That’s especially true when you need to replenish your Thunder pool after you’ve been Wounded and lost a bunch.

### Use Blights

Blights are a cheap way to invest in a future action, and especially among Mythenders who take many actions in a round to the Myth’s single one. You can either wait for it to be charged completely, or you can drain it earlier than that—don’t feel you’re required to wait until a Blight is fully charged before draining it.

A fine way to use Blights to your advantage is having the first Mythender in a round create a Blight and others charge it so the last Mythender in that round drains it.

### Pool Lightning

The Mythenders’ greatest advantage is the ability to pool their Lightning tokens together to cause effects. Don’t discount this ability you all have.

### Every Wound Matters

Even if your foe doesn’t lose much in the way of Thunder dice when Wounded, that still one Wound closer to needing to roll all ![6](/catalog/creators/ryan-macklin/mythender/thunder-6.svg)s. And if you increase the foe’s Wound number, one of two things will happen: they’ll lose more Thunder dice, or they’ll spend Lightning to counteract that raise. Either way, it’s a win for you.

### Drain Might

Given all the things that foes can do with Might tokens, your best bet is to give them reason to keep spending in order to drain their Might pool. This is especially true when fighting Greater Myths, as they begin battles with vast Thunder and Might pools and continue generating more dice and tokens. Gifts like <span class="keyword">Vicious Denial</span> exist to make the other person have to spend Might to continue acting normally, and the god’s <span class="keyword">One Last Breath</span> Gift is guaranteed to drain a lot of Might. The same is true for Gifts like <span class="keyword">Relentlessness</span>, <span class="keyword">Bloodlust</span>, and all the others that exist to make a bad roll useful, at a cost.

Goading a foe into using <span class="keyword">Swiftness</span> can be effective at draining Might, though at the expense of your foe taking another action against you.

Eventually, a Greater Myth’s Might pool will get low enough to where the Mythenders can take it down.

### Diversify in Gifts

If everyone has the <span class="keyword">Grievous Harm</span> Gift, sure, everyone can hit harder. But if you diversify, you can as a group achieve some pretty monumental things. For instance:

Rashid has the <span class="keyword">Grievous Harm</span> Gift with the <span class="keyword">Aiding</span> upgrade. Beatrice has the <span class="keyword">Master Tactician</span> Gift and the <span class="keyword">Harbinger of Storm</span> Gift with the <span class="keyword">Surging</span> upgrade, and Tzofiya has the <span class="keyword">Mighty Presence</span> Gift and the <span class="keyword">Relentlessness</span> Gift.

Beatrice can generate a significant amount of Thunder dice, thanks to the <span class="keyword">Surging</span> upgrade, and give much of that Thunder to Tzofiya thanks to <span class="keyword">Master Tactician</span>. Tzofiya generates much more Lighting on a Titanic action than others, and can reroll the failed dice thanks to <span class="keyword">Relentlessness</span>. Then, when she uses all those Lightning tokens to Wound a Myth, she can double down and Rashid can also aid her with his <span class="keyword">Grievous Harm</span>.

Pretty vicious, huh? Of course, all those tricks take quite a bit of Might to pull off, but when you can pull it off, it’s pretty damned explosive.

### Mythmaster: Push the Mythenders

It’s important to remember that the Mythmaster’s goal isn’t to kill the Mythenders; it’s to turn them, to make them Fall. And the best way to do that is to survive the battle as long as possible—the longer the battle, the more opportunity the Mythenders have to take on Mythic power and Corruption. Use every trick at your disposal to remain alive (which involves Wounding them as much as possible, so that their Thunder pools keep getting depleted.)

## Running Battle Example: Ben bar Yosef

Ben bar Yosef, a war-priest from a far distant land (<span class="keyword">Exile Crusader of Death</span>), is fighting against a dozen frost jötnar (**Mythic Norden**). Alongside him are two fellow Mythenders, Beatrice of Normandy and Rashid al-Jabbar. The battle is set on frosted plains with a few evergreen trees here and there, all darkened by storm clouds above.

This running example will use the structure from the Tutorial Battle chapter.

### First Turn

This is the first round; among the Mythenders, Ben is going first. (The Myth, as always, went before them.) He’s a fresh character, so nothing’s checked off. His Weapons:

    WEAPONS                                            +3 Dice  +2 Dice  +2 Might
    My righteous might in slaying demons …is my weapon     ☐☐     ☐☐     ☐☐
      ☒ Intrinsic  ☐ Relic  ☐ Companion
    My cursed mace, Exodus               …is my weapon     ☐☐     ☐☐     ☐☐
      ☐ Intrinsic  ☒ Relic  ☐ Companion
    My counselor and good friend, David  …is my weapon     ☐☐     ☐☐     ☐☐
      ☐ Intrinsic  ☐ Relic  ☒ Companion

#### Describing Being Awesome

Ben starts off with a Legendary action. He decides to launch right in with <span class="keyword">My righteous might in slaying demons</span>, charging it. He’s also going to describe using <span class="keyword">My cursed mace, Exodus</span>, but that’s less important to the description he’s about to do, so that won’t get charged.

His description:

**_Ben raises his mace, and with his might proven over and over by slaying demons in his own lands, he brings down a tree. The tree cracks and falls on one of the blasphemous giants!_**

He then checks off the <span class="keyword">+3 dice</span> charged box on that Weapon:

    My righteous might in slaying demons …is my weapon     ☒☐     ☐☐     ☐☐
      ☒ Intrinsic  ☐ Relic  ☐ Companion

#### Gathering & Rolling Dice

Ben has the base Storm rating of 3, so he grabs his 3 Storm dice. He has 1 Thunder die from
the start of the battle, and together, he rolls them: ![storm 3,](/catalog/creators/ryan-macklin/mythender/storm-3.svg) ![6,](/catalog/creators/ryan-macklin/mythender/storm-6.svg) ![4,](/catalog/creators/ryan-macklin/mythender/storm-4.svg) ![and thunder 4](/catalog/creators/ryan-macklin/mythender/thunder-4.svg).

That gives him 1 success on Thunder dice, giving him his first Lightning token of the battle, and 2 successes on his Storm pool, which means he gains 2 more Thunder dice (for a total of 3 Thunder dice in his pool).

#### Pushing Forward

Because Ben didn’t cause any effects, the Mythmaster describes what happens:

**_The tree comes crashing down, cracking one Frost Giant in the skull. Ice-blue blood drips from his head, and he screams in pain. The one beside him takes a step back from approaching the Mythender he first saw as puny._**

Note that the Mythender sells the narrative of Ben’s power in this moment of battle. Even though he didn’t create a lasting effect, Ben’s still a kickass Mythender, and that should always reflect in the storytelling.

## Running Battle Example (Part 2)

### Second Turn

At this point, everyone else has gone. Beatrice used her <span class="keyword">Unmatchable Guile</span> to frighten and confuse their foes, and Rashid use his <span class="keyword">Righteous Scimitar</span> to stab one and render it lame. At the top of the second round, the Myth went first. Now Ben’s going.

#### Describing Being Awesome

Ben will continue to use <span class="keyword">My righteous might in slaying demons</span>. He’s going to charge that Weapon again, this time checking off the <span class="keyword">+2 dice</span> charge box.

    WEAPONS                                            +3 Dice  +2 Dice  +2 Might
    My righteous might in slaying demons …is my weapon     ☒☐     ☒☐     ☐☐
      ☒ Intrinsic  ☐ Relic  ☐ Companion

This will be a Mythic action, so he’ll get to use the Mythic die and beef up his description of being awesome in battle:

**_Ben picks up the tree he fell—a tall, massive hulk of a thing—by the trunk and beats the nearest giant to death._**

The Mythmaster stops the action for a second, and asks “Is that all? This is Mythic?”

Ben’s player questions him with “Isn’t a small dude picking up a giant tree Mythic enough?” but decides to take the opening anyway, and adds more.

**_Ben picks up the tree he fell—a tall, massive hulk of a thing—by the trunk and beats the nearest giant to death. Not satisfied with that, he then hurls the tree at the giant in the distance conjuring foul magics, piercing him in the chest._**

The Mythmaster has no problem with Ben describing killing one of the twelve giants, because there’s still eleven to go, and this is a Mythic action. (See **The Shape of Foes**.)

#### Gathering & Rolling Dice

Ben grabs his 3 Storm dice, the 3 Thunder dice in his pool, and the Mythic die. He rolls them: ![storm 5,](/catalog/creators/ryan-macklin/mythender/storm-5.svg) ![2,](/catalog/creators/ryan-macklin/mythender/storm-2.svg) ![5,](/catalog/creators/ryan-macklin/mythender/storm-5.svg) ![thunder 3,](/catalog/creators/ryan-macklin/mythender/thunder-3.svg) ![3,](/catalog/creators/ryan-macklin/mythender/thunder-3.svg) ![1,](/catalog/creators/ryan-macklin/mythender/thunder-1.svg) ![and mythic 4](/catalog/creators/ryan-macklin/mythender/mythic-4.svg).

He gets 6 more Thunder dice for his pool! Two are from the 2 Storm successes, and 4 from the number on the Mythic die. But no Lightning this time. Oh no!

#### Suffering Corruption

Because Ben rolled the Mythic die, he must suffer Corruption. As he’s a fresh character, he has no Corruption checked yet, so he checks off the first Corruption box:

    Corruption
     → ☒ 4 → ☐ 4    Paragon: I appear as… My mace bleeds and wails with mothers’ laments
              ↓
       ☐ 3 ← ☐ 3    Supernatural: I appear as… My face loses flesh, showing Death’s skull-face
        ↓
       ☐ 2 → ☐ 2    Godly: I appear as… A giant bone-god, with vast bleached-white bat wings

That isn’t enough for Ben to change form yet, so he appears as normal: <span class="keyword">a short man in full plate armor, whose eyes have seen countless deaths</span>.

#### Suffering Fate

    Fate GIFTS         Might Cost
     X •  Bloodlust         2
     ☒ •  ______________    2

Because Ben rolled the Mythic die, he has to see if he Suffers Fate. His Corruption number is 4 (from the Corruption box he just checked), and the Mythic die is ![4](/catalog/creators/ryan-macklin/mythender/mythic-4.svg)—that’s equal to or higher than the Corruption number, so he suffers Fate!

He checks off the his first Fate box, giving him a new Gift slot to use now or later. For now, he’ll hold off filling one in.

#### Pushing Forward

Ben wants to make a Blight from this, but he only has 1 Lightning token. That’s half the cost of a Blight, so another Mythender can help him out. Rashid tosses him 1 Lightning token from his pool. Ben then takes a Blight card and makes a new Blight (see below).

Because he caused an effect, he gets to Push Forward:

**_The tree pins that second jötunn down with a solid thud that all standing can feel. As he struggles to get up, he’s buried in the beginning of what becomes an avalanche that rivals the Flood in magnitude!_**

He then checks the Blight’s first charge box before tossing the card on the table for the other Mythenders to use:

### Myth’s Turn & Being Wounded

#### Myth’s Action

The frost jötnar are not taking this “get beat up by Mythenders” crap lying down. (Well, except for the one that Ben beat to death… and the one pinned to the ground by a tree.)

On his turn, the Mythmaster describes the giants rushing all three of them, carving a way through their Companions with their horrendous Weapons of ice. The Myth has the first two charge boxes checked off, and drains them for five bonus dice.

    WEAPONS                                            +3 Dice  +2 Dice  +2 Might
    Ice weapons sharper than any steel  …is my weapon     ☒☒     ☒☒     ☐☐
      ☐ Intrinsic  ☒ Relic  ☐ Companion

Since this is a Relic Weapon, it doesn’t cost Might to make these bonus Thunder dice. They also have a Blight from earlier, <span class="keyword">Ice Spears Emerging From The Ground</span>, that charging will grant a bonus Storm die.

(Note: because this is using the Tutorial Battle format, the Mythmaster changed the frost jötnar’s stats from what they are in the Norden chapter.)

The Mythmaster rolls a bunch of dice: 4 Storm dice, 1 bonus Storm die, 7 Thunder dice, and 5 bonus Thunder dice: ![storm 3,](/catalog/creators/ryan-macklin/mythender/storm-3.svg) ![6,](/catalog/creators/ryan-macklin/mythender/storm-6.svg) ![2,](/catalog/creators/ryan-macklin/mythender/storm-2.svg) ![5, ](/catalog/creators/ryan-macklin/mythender/storm-5.svg) ![5,](/catalog/creators/ryan-macklin/mythender/storm-5.svg) ![thunder 3,](/catalog/creators/ryan-macklin/mythender/thunder-3.svg) ![5,](/catalog/creators/ryan-macklin/mythender/thunder-5.svg) ![2,](/catalog/creators/ryan-macklin/mythender/thunder-2.svg) ![3,](/catalog/creators/ryan-macklin/mythender/thunder-3.svg) ![1,](/catalog/creators/ryan-macklin/mythender/thunder-1.svg) ![3,](/catalog/creators/ryan-macklin/mythender/thunder-3.svg) ![4,](/catalog/creators/ryan-macklin/mythender/thunder-4.svg) ![and bonus 6,](/catalog/creators/ryan-macklin/mythender/bonus-6.svg) ![6,](/catalog/creators/ryan-macklin/mythender/bonus-6.svg) ![2,](/catalog/creators/ryan-macklin/mythender/bonus-2.svg) ![4,](/catalog/creators/ryan-macklin/mythender/bonus-4.svg) ![3](/catalog/creators/ryan-macklin/mythender/bonus-3.svg).

That gives the Myth 3 more Thunder dice for its pool, and 5 Lightning tokens to add to its existing 4 Lightning.

#### Using a Gift

The Mythmaster decides that’s not enough, and pays 2 of the Myth’s 8 Might tokens to use the <span class="keyword">Relentlessness</span> Gift (**Your Heart’s Gifts**)—that means he’ll reroll the failed Thunder dice, including the bonus Thunder dice, coming up with: ![thunder 5,](/catalog/creators/ryan-macklin/mythender/thunder-5.svg) ![3,](/catalog/creators/ryan-macklin/mythender/thunder-3.svg) ![4,](/catalog/creators/ryan-macklin/mythender/thunder-4.svg) ![4,](/catalog/creators/ryan-macklin/mythender/thunder-4.svg) ![2,](/catalog/creators/ryan-macklin/mythender/thunder-2.svg) ![and bonus 3, ](/catalog/creators/ryan-macklin/mythender/bonus-3.svg) ![6](/catalog/creators/ryan-macklin/mythender/bonus-6.svg). The Myth gets 9 Lightning tokens instead of 5. It’s about time to Wound the Mythenders!

The Myth spends 3 of its 13 Lightning tokens to Wound Ben—all Mythenders have a Wound Cost of 3. It also spends 3 more to Wound Beatrice and a further 3 to Wound Rashid (total of 9 Lightning spent).

#### Ben’s Wound

    ☒ 3

This is Ben’s first Wound, so he’s going to check off the first Wound box: 3.

He rolls the 9 Thunder dice in his pool, and hopes for ![3](/catalog/creators/ryan-macklin/mythender/thunder-3.svg)s and higher on each: ![3,](/catalog/creators/ryan-macklin/mythender/thunder-3.svg) ![2,](/catalog/creators/ryan-macklin/mythender/thunder-2.svg) ![4,](/catalog/creators/ryan-macklin/mythender/thunder-4.svg) ![5,](/catalog/creators/ryan-macklin/mythender/thunder-5.svg) ![1,](/catalog/creators/ryan-macklin/mythender/thunder-1.svg) ![3,](/catalog/creators/ryan-macklin/mythender/thunder-3.svg) ![6,](/catalog/creators/ryan-macklin/mythender/thunder-6.svg) ![2,](/catalog/creators/ryan-macklin/mythender/thunder-2.svg) ![1](/catalog/creators/ryan-macklin/mythender/thunder-1.svg).

Four dice were less than ![3](/catalog/creators/ryan-macklin/mythender/thunder-3.svg), so they’re discarded, leaving Ben with 5 Thunder dice. He’s still alive! But a bit worse for wear. The Mythmaster pushes forward with some vicious description:

**_The giants hurl their ice-weapons (the Weapon) into the air, and they hammer down as the Ice Spears (the Blight) in the ground thrust up, finding purchase in each of your Mythenders. Your blood flows into the thirsty ground as you are each stuck like pigs prepared for a great feast!_**

#### Ben’s Companion Weapon

Ben has a Companion Weapon, <span class="keyword">My counselor and good friend, David</span>. As with all Companions, he’s charged when Ben is Wounded. David hasn’t been charged yet this game, so he gets his first charge, <span class="keyword">+3 dice</span>:

    My counselor and good friend, David  …is my weapon     ☒☐     ☐☐     ☐☐
      ☐ Intrinsic  ☐ Relic  ☒ Companion

#### But Wait! Ben Uses a Gift

Ben has the <span class="keyword">Bloodlust</span> Gift (**Your Heart’s Gifts**), which lets him gain Lightning for each Thunder die lost, at the cost of 2 Might tokens. Ben spends 2 Might and gets 4 Lightning to put in his empty pool. Take that, frost jötnar!

## Running Battle Example (Page 4)

### Third & Final Turn

Ben is about to get his righteous vengeance on! He decided to go second this round, letting Beatrice further charge up their Blight (which she and Rashid also charged on previous turns).

#### Describing Being Awesome

Ben will use the same Weapon again, and this time he’ll drain it. Not only that, but he’s going to do a Titanic action, and drain the Blight as well! Loads of dice!

    WEAPONS                                            +3 Dice  +2 Dice  +2 Might
    My righteous might in slaying demons …is my weapon     ☒☒     ☒☒     ☐☐
      ☒ Intrinsic  ☐ Relic  ☐ Companion

> **BLIGHT** ☐ Lasting

> Description: The Avalanche!
>
> Created by: Ben, slayer of demons
>
> Charges: ☒▸☒▸☒▸☒▸☐

         ↓

> Charges: ☐▸☐▸☐▸☐▸☐

Because Ben is doing a Titanic action, he won’t be rolling any Storm dice. Normally, the bonus dice from draining a Weapon is bonus Storm. He can turn that into bonus Thunder dice by paying 2 Might—it’s free for Relics, but he’s been charging an Intrinsic Weapon.

He also gets bonus Thunder dice for draining the Blight. Between the 4 charges on the Blight and the 5 bonus dice from draining his Weapon, he gets 9 bonus Thunder dice…on top of the 5 Thunder dice in his pool!

He’ll also have to roll the Mythic die, and make this description more insane than before. Since he knows he’ll change to his Paragon Form (see below), he works that in:

**_Ben’s mace begins to pour blood, blood that wails with the lament of every mother whose son or daughter Ben has brutally slain when he was a young and foolish warrior. He wipes some of the blood on his hands. Then he goes to pick up a thick branch off of the tree he hurled. He walks slowly, and no one stops him; no one dares._**

**_With those bloody hands, he grips the branch and chokes it, staring at the throats of all the giants still standing. “You are nothing! You are all less than this branch I hold! Feel my might!” And as he chokes the branch, the giants all fall to their knees, choking as well. Iceblood spurts from their mouths, and that blood wails their mothers’ lament._**

The Mythmaster backs up. “Yes…that is Titanic.”

“Fuck yes, it is,” Ben’s player says.

#### Gathering & Rolling Dice

Ben grabs his 5 Thunder dice, 9 bonus Thunder dice, and the Mythic die. He rolls them and gets: ![thunder 4,](/catalog/creators/ryan-macklin/mythender/thunder-4.svg) ![3,](/catalog/creators/ryan-macklin/mythender/thunder-3.svg) ![2,](/catalog/creators/ryan-macklin/mythender/thunder-2.svg) ![5,](/catalog/creators/ryan-macklin/mythender/thunder-5.svg) ![3,](/catalog/creators/ryan-macklin/mythender/thunder-3.svg) ![bonus 5,](/catalog/creators/ryan-macklin/mythender/bonus-5.svg) ![6,](/catalog/creators/ryan-macklin/mythender/bonus-6.svg) ![3,](/catalog/creators/ryan-macklin/mythender/bonus-3.svg) ![2,](/catalog/creators/ryan-macklin/mythender/bonus-2.svg) ![4,](/catalog/creators/ryan-macklin/mythender/bonus-4.svg) ![5,](/catalog/creators/ryan-macklin/mythender/bonus-5.svg) ![1,](/catalog/creators/ryan-macklin/mythender/bonus-1.svg) ![6,](/catalog/creators/ryan-macklin/mythender/bonus-6.svg) ![4,](/catalog/creators/ryan-macklin/mythender/bonus-4.svg) ![and mythic 3](/catalog/creators/ryan-macklin/mythender/mythic-3.svg).

Each success gives him 3 Lightning. Seven successes means 21 Lightning! Well enough to seriously Wound this Myth. But as this is a Titanic Action, all of the failures are discarded; Ben will only have 2 Thunder dice left after this turn. Still, he plans on there not being a turn after this one.

Since this was a Titanic action, the Mythic die grants him additional Might: in this case, 3 Might tokens for the ![3](/catalog/creators/ryan-macklin/mythender/mythic-3.svg) on the die.

#### Suffering Corruption

Because Ben rolled the Mythic die again, he’ll have to suffer Corruption. Since he’s suffered Corruption once before, he’ll check off the next Corruption box:

    → ☒ 4 → ☒ 4    Paragon: I appear as… My mace bleeds and wails with mothers’ laments

Ben already described turning into this Form. Because the Mythic Die was less than the Corruption Number of 4, Ben is able to resist his Fate. He could choose to let it happen anyway, but Ben’s in the Mythending business, not the Mythmaking one, so he doesn’t.

#### Pushing Forward

    WOUNDS
    ☒ 3
      ↓
    ☒ 4
      ↓
    ☐ 5
      ↓
      6

With the 4 Lightning he had at the start of this turn, he has 25 Lightning now. The frost jötnar have a Wound Cost of 4, so he gladly pays 8 Lightning to double down the Wound. The Myth was already Wounded once, in the previous turn by Beatrice, so it checks off its second box: 4.

With the doubling down, the Wound number becomes 5 (though the 4 box remains checked, not the 5). Ben has an open Gift slot, so he fills that slot with the <span class="keyword">Grievous Harm</span> Gift (**Your Heart’s Gifts**)—that lets him pay 2 Might tokens to increase the Wound number by an additional 1. He grins as he does so and pays the Might.

The Myth now only keeps ![thunder 6](/catalog/creators/ryan-macklin/mythender/thunder-6.svg)s when rolling its Wound. It had 10 Thunder dice when Beatrice Wounded it, and lost 4 dice, leaving 6.

The Mythmaster rolls: ![thunder 3,](/catalog/creators/ryan-macklin/mythender/thunder-3.svg) ![5,](/catalog/creators/ryan-macklin/mythender/thunder-5.svg) ![1,](/catalog/creators/ryan-macklin/mythender/thunder-1.svg) ![2,](/catalog/creators/ryan-macklin/mythender/thunder-2.svg) ![5,](/catalog/creators/ryan-macklin/mythender/thunder-5.svg) ![and 4](/catalog/creators/ryan-macklin/mythender/thunder-4.svg). No ![6](/catalog/creators/ryan-macklin/mythender/thunder-6.svg)s! The Myth is Ended!

Ben starts his description of the Ending, and everyone else, including the Mythmaster, join in. There is some rejoicing, some wailing of jötnar mothers, and a lot of Mythic Power flowing around.

## Battle in Brief

### Starting Rounds & Action Order

The Myth always starts off each round. After that, the Mythenders may choose their order. Once everyone has gone, a new round begins again (provided that both sides are still alive).

### Describe Being Awesome

Describe how you’re bringing the pain to your foes. Don’t skimp on the awesome.

#### Scale

Mythenders have a choice of three scales: Legendary, where you’re doing general badassery; Mythic, where you’re tapping more into Mythic power and accepting Corruption; and Titanic, where you’re tapping so much into Myth that it hurts you while it gives you power.

<span class="keyword">Legendary actions</span> involve rolling Storm and Thunder dice. <span class="keyword">Mythic actions</span> also involve the Mythic die and Corruption. <span class="keyword">Titanic actions</span> involve the Mythic die, Corruption, and risking your Thunder dice to gain many more Lightning and Might tokens.

Myths don’t choose a scale. Everything is described however the Mythmaster likes. From a rules perspective, Myths only roll Legendary actions.

#### Weapon

You’ll charge or drain a Weapon. If you’re charging a Weapon, you’ll check off one charge box. If you’re draining a Weapon, you’ll check off all the drain boxes that are charged, and gain bonuses based on the boxes drained.

Bonuses from Weapons are Storm dice, though they may become Thunder dice by spending 2 Might tokens—or free, if using a Relic Weapon.

#### Blight

You may charge or drain a Blight. If you’re charging a Blight, you’ll gain 1 bonus Storm die. If you’re draining a Blight, you’ll erase all of its charges and gain 1 bonus Thunder die for each charge drained.

### Roll Dice & Gain Power

#### Legendary Actions & Myth Actions

For each Thunder die that’s ![4](/catalog/creators/ryan-macklin/mythender/thunder-4.svg), ![5](/catalog/creators/ryan-macklin/mythender/thunder-5.svg), or ![6](/catalog/creators/ryan-macklin/mythender/thunder-6.svg), gain 1 Lightning token. Roll your Storm and Thunder. For each Storm die that’s ![4](/catalog/creators/ryan-macklin/mythender/storm-4.svg), ![5](/catalog/creators/ryan-macklin/mythender/storm-5.svg), or ![6](/catalog/creators/ryan-macklin/mythender/storm-6.svg), gain 1 Thunder die. Take the dice you rolled and all your gains back to their respective pools on your playsheet, discarding all bonus dice.

#### Mythic Actions

Same as Legendary Actions, but also roll the Mythic die. Gain additional Thunder dice equal to the number on the Mythic die (![4](/catalog/creators/ryan-macklin/mythender/mythic-4.svg) means 4 Thunder dice, for example).

#### Titanic Actions

Roll only Thunder dice, and the Mythic die. For each Thunder die that’s ![4](/catalog/creators/ryan-macklin/mythender/thunder-4.svg), ![5](/catalog/creators/ryan-macklin/mythender/thunder-5.svg), or ![6](/catalog/creators/ryan-macklin/mythender/thunder-6.svg), gain 3 Lightning tokens. Discard each that were 3 or less. Gain Might tokens equal to the number on the Mythic die (![4](/catalog/creators/ryan-macklin/mythender/mythic-4.svg) means 4 Might tokens, for example).

#### The Mythic Die & Suffering Corruption

Immediately suffer Corruption and check to see if you’re force to progress your Fate by comparing the Mythic die to your Corruption number. If you progress your Fate, gain a new Gift slot, which may be filled at any time. If you aren’t forced to, you may still chose to progress your Fate.

### Push Forward

You may spend Lightning to <span class="keyword">cause a Wound</span>. Refer to your foe’s Wound cost.

_Myths_: if Wounding multiple foes, spend 3 Lightning tokens or 1 Might token for each additional foe. When a foe is Wounded, he checks off the next Wound box and rolls his Thunder dice, keeping only those that are equal to or higher than the Wound number.

You may spend Lightning tokens to <span class="keyword">cause a Blight</span> and <span class="keyword">destroy a Blight</span>. Causing a Blight costs 2 Lightning tokens. Destroying a Blight costs 3 Lightning tokens for each charge box checked (minimum 0); if the Blight is Lasting, 6 Lightning tokens for each charge box (minimum 6).

You may cause a Wound, cause a Blight, and destroy a Blight all in the same action, but you may not do more than one of any of those (e.g. Wound twice, make two Blights).

Mythenders who cause effects describe Pushing Forward. Otherwise, the Mythmaster describes Pushing Forward for Mythenders that don’t spend effects, as well as for the Myth.

### Death

If a Mythender loses all his Thunder dice—due to being Wounded or rolling a treacherous Titanic action—he may choose between dying and embracing Fate to stave off death. If a Myth loses all its Thunder dice, the battle is over with the Mythenders victorious!

### Myth’s Special Tricks

At the beginning of each round after the first, a Myth gains Might equal to its recharge rate. At the end of each round, a Gathering Rage power activates.

### Weapon Types

Undrained charges from <span class="keyword">Intrinsic Weapons</span> are retained after a battle at no cost.

Bonus dice from <span class="keyword">Relic Weapons</span> may be Thunder dice at no cost.

<span class="keyword">Companion Weapons</span> gain a free change when you’re Wounded.

### Gifts

You may use a Gift you have whenever appropriate, but each one only once per turn unless otherwise specified. You may only use the <span class="keyword">Swiftness</span> Gift once per round.

Gift slots you gain may be immediately filled in and that Gift used right away, provided you can spend the Might cost and the Gift is something you can do right at the moment you take it. You may also hold off on filling in that Gift slot until a later time, in which case you can use it as soon as you fill it in (provided you’re able to use it in that moment).

# Your Heart’s Gifts

## About Gifts

<span class="keyword">Gifts</span> are the abilities that your Mythic Heart grants you as you slide closer and closer to Mythic oblivion. They allow you to change the rules of battle.

Most Gifts cost Might tokens to trigger them, which you can gain through draining the <span class="keyword">+2 Might</span> Weapon charge box, doing Titanic actions, or Terrorizing Mortals for Power. Some also require you to incorporate some description into your narrative, though if what you’ve described already involves that, you don’t need to go further.

Every Mythender begins with one Gift at character creation, specified by the Heart taken. Myths also have a number of Gifts: three to five for Lesser Myths and as many as ten for Greater Myths (counting upgrades).

### Gaining New Gifts

As new Fate boxes are checked, the Gift slots next to them become unlocked. If you have an empty Gift slot, you may fill it in _at any time_ with a new Gift or upgrade, interrupting whatever you’re doing at that moment. You may use that Gift right away, provided you can pay the Might cost and it’s something you can use in that moment.

_**Example: Yolen rolls for his action, and gets a number of failures. He has an empty Gift slot, and wants to get more out of his roll. He could take the <span class="keyword">Relentlessness</span> Gift, that allows rerolling failed dice. He could also take the <span class="keyword">Sureness</span> Gift, which allows dice of ![3](/catalog/creators/ryan-macklin/mythender/storm-3.svg) or higher to be successes, but because that’s done before the roll, he couldn’t use it on this turn.**_

### Losing Gifts

If you **Seek Sympathy & Healing**, you can choose to reduce the Fate boxes checked. If you do, you lose the Gift slots associated with those Fate boxes. Erase the Gifts in those boxes, if any. (Because you cannot reduce your permanent Fate boxes, any Gifts in those locations are permanent as well.)

If you progress your Fate further in the future, you may choose the same of different Gifts for those reopened slots.

Mythenders also lose any Gifts associated with non-permanent Fate box when the adventure is over and a new one begins.

### Base Gifts & Upgrades

The list details all the Gifts. Each one has a basic option, and many come with upgrades. These upgrades may be taken whenever you fill in a new Gift slot, improving a Gift you already have. You may only take a Gift or upgrade once, unless otherwise stated. When choosing an upgrade, you may choose any of those listed. They aren’t sequential upgrade trees or anything like that.

#### Changing Might Costs

Upgrades that change Might costs (explicitly stating “more” or “fewer”) are cumulative. Any that state an absolute amount to pay, not more or fewer, are separate costs. No Gift costs fewer than 0 Might tokens.

### Once Per Action

Unless otherwise specified, each Gift can only be used once per action, though multiple different Gifts can be used in a single action. (The <span class="keyword">Swiftness</span> Gift may be used only once per round.)

#### Aiding Upgrades

Some Gifts have an <span class="keyword">Aiding</span> upgrade, which allows a Mythender to use their Gift for someone else. This counts as using that Gift this action; if they also have the same Gift, only one of you can use it at the moment.

### Action Restrictions on Gifts

Some Gifts have restrictions on the actions they work for, such as saying a Gift only normally works for Legendary and Mythic actions. If these Gifts are available to the Myth, it has no such restrictions, since it doesn’t have a scale of action.

### Myth-only & Mythender-only Gifts

Most Gifts are available to both sides. But some are only available to Mythenders, and some are only available to Myths. These are noted as such.

### Non-Action Gifts

While most Gifts involve modifying an action (such as the die pool roll or the Wound, whether it’s your action or you’re the target of another’s action), there are a couple that just provide an immediate effect upon taking it and don’t do anything after that: <span class="keyword">Channeled Hatred</span> and <span class="keyword">Surge of Might</span>. These remain on your list of Gifts once taken, but do not provide benefit to future actions.

The Myth-only Gift <span class="keyword">Building Doom</span> is a non-action Gift that provides a continual benefit.

## List of Gifts

### Blaze of Glory

<span class="gift-qualifier">Mythenders only</span>

Whenever you roll the <span class="keyword">Mythic die</span> in Battle, roll a second Mythic die and combine the results. This costs no Might. If you have this Gift, you _must_ do this.

This is considered a single die for the purposes of risking your Fate, so you’re almost guaranteed to progress your Fate, as you’ll rarely get a result lower than 4.

### Bloodlust

Pay <span class="keyword">2 Might tokens</span> when you’re Wounded and have lost Thunder dice. Gain Lightning tokens equal to the Thunder dice lost.

If a Mythender dies and comes back, all the Thunder dice lost before coming back count for this Gift.

#### Upgrades

<span class="keyword">Dangerous</span>: Pay <span class="keyword">3 more Might</span>, gain Lightning equal to twice Thunder dice lost instead.

<span class="keyword">Quick</span>: Pay <span class="keyword">1 fewer Might</span> to use this Gift.

### Building Doom

<span class="gift-qualifier">Myths only, Non-Action</span>

At the beginning of each round after the first, increase your Storm rating by 1.

#### Upgrades

<span class="keyword">True Dread</span>: Increase Storm rating by 2 instead of 1 each round.

### Channeled Hatred

<span class="gift-qualifier">Mythenders only, Non-Action</span>

At the time of taking this gift, gain Lighting equal to twice the number of Gifts you have taken (including this one). When doing this, describe how you are ripping raw power from the Mythic World and pouring it into your Weapons and body.

You may take this Gift multiple times, but only once per round.

### Dual Wield

Pay <span class="keyword">1 Might token</span> when acting; you may charge two Weapons, or charge one Weapon and drain another, on the same turn. You must incorporate both Weapons into your description.

Alternatively, pay <span class="keyword">3 Might tokens</span> to drain two Weapons on the same turn.

### Fast Strike

Pay <span class="keyword">1 Might token</span> when acting, you may charge and drain with a Weapon on the same turn. Incorporate some advanced tactic with this Weapon in your description. (The charge and drain both happen before dice are gathered.)

This effect may stack with <span class="keyword">Dual Wield</span>, but only for one Weapon you wish to drain.

### Focused Onslaught

When charging a Blight, mark two charge boxes. This costs no Might.

You may also pay <span class="keyword">2 Might tokens</span> to gain double bonus Thunder from draining a Blight, but then the Blight is destroyed. Describe how you tax it beyond existence.

### Grievous Harm

Pay <span class="keyword">2 Might tokens</span> when Wounding, before the Wound is rolled. Raise the target’s <span class="keyword">Wound number</span> by 1. Describe how your Wound is severe and vicious. Spend before the target rolls the Wound.

_Note_: this doesn’t change what <span class="keyword">Wound box</span> is checked, just the number during this action.

#### Upgrades

<span class="keyword">Vicious</span>: Pay <span class="keyword">2 more Might</span>, increase the target’s Wound number by 2 instead of 1.

<span class="keyword">Precise</span>: May pay after seeing the result of the target’s Wound roll. Must pay <span class="keyword">1 more Might</span> if done after the Wound roll.

<span class="keyword">Aiding</span>: Pay <span class="keyword">1 more Might</span> during an ally’s turn, they gain this benefit.

### Harbinger of Storm

<span class="gift-qualifier">Mythenders only (except for Surging), Non-Action</span>

Add 2 to your Storm rating. This costs no Might.

#### Upgrades

<span class="keyword">Raging</span>: Add 2 more to your Storm rating, for a total of 4.

<span class="keyword">Surging</span>: Pay <span class="keyword">2 Might tokens</span> when acting; gain double Thunder from your Storm dice. Pay before rolling. Describe how you’re carefully plotting the action to full advantage.

_Note_: Myths may take the <span class="keyword">Surging</span> upgrade as a base Gift.

### Indestructible Nature

<span class="gift-qualifier">Myths only</span>

Pay <span class="keyword">2 Might tokens</span> when creating a Blight. This Blight cannot be destroyed until either it’s drained or the battle is over.

### Master Tactician

<span class="gift-qualifier">Mythenders only</span>

Pay <span class="keyword">1 Might token</span> on your action or an ally’s action, move up to 5 Thunder dice from yourself to that willing character or vice versa. Must have that Mythender’s permission. Describe how you two are cooperating and show your cunning plan.

Pay <span class="keyword">1 more Might</span> for every 5 additional Thunder dice you move.

#### Upgrades

<span class="keyword">Foresight</span>: May move Thunder dice from any willing character to any other willing character, not just involving you.

<span class="keyword">Quick</span>: Pay <span class="keyword">1 fewer Might</span> to use these benefits.

### Mighty Presence

<span class="gift-qualifier">Mythenders only</span>

On a Titanic action, gain 4 Lightning tokens instead of 3 for each successful Thunder die.

### One More Breath

<span class="gift-qualifier">Myths only</span>

If you’re Wounded and did not lose all your Thunder dice, you may pay <span class="keyword">1 Might token</span> after rolling your Wound. Rotate a single Thunder die up one face (a ![3](/catalog/creators/ryan-macklin/mythender/thunder-3.svg) becomes a ![4](/catalog/creators/ryan-macklin/mythender/thunder-4.svg), a ![5](/catalog/creators/ryan-macklin/mythender/thunder-5.svg) becomes a ![6](/catalog/creators/ryan-macklin/mythender/thunder-6.svg)). You cannot rotate a die higher than ![6](/catalog/creators/ryan-macklin/mythender/thunder-6.svg). You may rotate as many dice as you wish, at the cost of 1 Might token per die per face rotated; for example, turning a ![3](/catalog/creators/ryan-macklin/mythender/thunder-3.svg) ![4](/catalog/creators/ryan-macklin/mythender/thunder-4.svg) into a ![5](/catalog/creators/ryan-macklin/mythender/thunder-5.svg) ![5](/catalog/creators/ryan-macklin/mythender/thunder-5.svg) costs 3 Might tokens.

In addition, you may pay <span class="keyword">5 Might tokens</span> when Ended to attempt to corrupt one of the Mythenders who just Ended you. If that Mythender needs to check for Apotheosis at the end of this battle, she’ll roll the die twice and use the higher result.

_Note_: this may be used after activating the <span class="keyword">Relentlessness</span> Gift with the <span class="keyword">Unrepentant</span> upgrade. Use the <span class="keyword">Relentlessness</span> reroll before applying this Gift.

### Relentlessness

Pay <span class="keyword">2 Might tokens</span> after rolling a Legendary or Mythic action. Reroll failed Storm or Thunder dice (including any failed bonus Storm or Thunder dice). Spend after rolling. Describe how you’re pushing harder to recover from a fumble.

Pay <span class="keyword">2 more Might</span> tokens to use on a Titanic action.

Pay <span class="keyword">double Might cost</span> to reroll failed Storm _and_ Thunder dice.

#### Upgrades

<span class="keyword">Aiding</span>: May pay to affect a willing character on their turn.

<span class="keyword">Unrepentant</span>: Pay <span class="keyword">3 Might tokens</span> when Wounded, use this benefit on your Wound roll.

### Sureness

Pay <span class="keyword">3 Might tokens</span> during a Legendary or Mythic action; count ![3](/catalog/creators/ryan-macklin/mythender/storm-3.svg)s and higher as successes on Storm and Thunder. Pay <span class="keyword">2 more Might tokens</span> to do so on a Titanic action. Must pay before rolling.

#### Upgrades

<span class="keyword">Precise</span>: Pay <span class="keyword">1 more Might</span> to use this Gift after rolling instead of before.

<span class="keyword">Quick</span>: Pay <span class="keyword">1 fewer Might</span> to use these benefits.

<span class="keyword">Unyielding</span>: Pay <span class="keyword">2 more Might</span>, count ![2](/catalog/creators/ryan-macklin/mythender/storm-2.svg)s and higher as successes.

### Surge of Might

<span class="gift-qualifier">Mythenders only, Non-Action</span>

At the time of taking this Gift, gain 5 Might tokens. Describe how you acquire and drain this new wellspring of power.

You may take this Gift multiple times, but only once per round.

### Swiftness

Pay <span class="keyword">8 Might tokens</span> to take an additional action. This action must be after your first action in this round, but cannot be immediately after your first. Myths cannot use this at the end of the round—that would given them two actions in a row (the Swiftness action and the first action of the next round).

Mythenders who use Swiftness must make a Mythic or Titanic action.

If more than one person wants to use this Gift at the same time, the rule: if the Myth is one of them, the Myth gets to go. Otherwise, the Mythenders decide amongst themselves.

#### Upgrades

<span class="keyword">Aiding</span>: Allow another willing character to take this extra turn, instead of you. That character may only benefit from Swiftness once per round.

<span class="keyword">Quick</span>: Pay <span class="keyword">2 fewer Might</span> to use these benefits.

<span class="keyword">Bloody</span>: Pay <span class="keyword">5 Might tokens</span>, act before the Myth in battle. Only one Mythender may take advantage of this ability for any given battle. Note that the Myth’s Wound cost will be tripled during this action (**Wounding Your Foe**).

### Vicious Denial

<span class="gift-qualifier">Myths only</span>

Pay <span class="keyword">2 Might tokens</span> when Wounding. Pick a foe’s Relic or Companion Weapon. Describe how you deny that Weapon from them temporarily. The next time they use that Weapon, they must pay <span class="keyword">2 Might tokens</span> before rolling to do so, and describe in their action how they get it back. (This includes if a Myth wishes to Sunder the Weapon, **The Myth’s Tricks**.)

This is the one time where a Weapon can be denied, contrary to **Your Weapons are Inseparable** section. The denial ends at with the battle does, if it isn’t ended beforehand.

## Making New Gifts

Making new Gifts is easily one of the most delicate parts of <span class="mythender">Mythender</span>. If you tweak the wrong part of the game’s economy, it will cause the game to either feel way too easy or grind to a halt. And while creating new Gifts is far more art than science, here are some touchstones I’ve found in making mine (mostly in the form of problems I’ve encountered) that could help you in making yours.

First of all, no Gift should ever alter the results of the Mythic die (save for <span class="keyword">Blaze of Glory</span>); any Gift that allows you to reroll it will either be used to cheat Fate by trying to get a lower number or steal more power by trying to get a higher one. And that gives the Mythender too much agency over his Mythic Heart. The reason <span class="keyword">Blaze of Glory</span> works is because it represents the Mythender buying a bit more into the Heart’s bargain, but still has no more control or influence on what the results will be.

Be careful when altering the Wound Cost on a Mythender; if you raise it even by 1, the effect is dramatic: the Myth’s best tactical option is to always Wound that Mythender if it’s just going to pay Might to Wound the others in the group. Rather that creating any sense of invulnerability, it draws aggression. Sure, it costs more to Wound, but that’s only 1 extra Lightning token—and if you increase it much farther, the Myth’s economy (having only one effective player on its side) isn’t strong enough to catch up. On the other hand, there’s certainly room to play with the Wound Cost, especially in some temporary or fluctuating manner.

Beware of Gifts that allow Mythenders or Lesser Myths the ability to mitigate Wounds. In early versions of <span class="mythender">Mythender</span>, there was a Gift called “Reduce Harm” which allowed you to pay 2 Might tokens to drop a Wound number by 1. That became the rule for reducing with Lightning tokens, because the game just turned into a war of Might attrition that wasn’t interesting, and made people less enthusiastic about using <span class="keyword">Grievous Harm</span> against a foe with a large die pool who could mitigate it before rolling. The Gifts that do that now, <span class="keyword">One More Breath</span> for gods and <span class="keyword">Relentlessness</span>’s <span class="keyword">Unrepentant</span> upgrade, are based on what happens after the Wound roll is made, and are more expensive than the cost of <span class="keyword">Grievous Harm</span> (in the case of <span class="keyword">Unrepentant</span>, also in that it takes two Gift slots to have).

Once you have an idea for a Gift’s effect, you’ll need to figure out its Might cost. The Relentlessness Gift is the best baseline; how does your Gift match up to being able to reroll a dozen failed dice? In general, a Gift costs 1 Might token if it modifies the player’s own action with certainty, before the roll is made. Gifts that modify with uncertainty—rerolling dice, changing what the results of the dice mean, etc.—cost at least 2 Might, as do any Gifts that modify someone else’s action or reaction to your effect. Gifts that don’t have an action associated with them or are just one-time benefits typically have no Might cost—but you can also tweak that dial if in play your Gift feels under- or overpriced.

While most of the straightforward Gifts have been made, there are some in this chapter and plenty of potential others that play with non-obvious benefits that become magnified in conjunction with other Gifts. Everyone’s going to take Gifts like <span class="keyword">Relentlessness</span> and <span class="keyword">Grievous Harm</span>—those are the obvious picks. By contrast, <span class="keyword">Vicious Denial</span> provides a new purchasable effect, <span class="keyword">Mighty Presence</span> increases the Lightning tokens gained on a Titanic action, <span class="keyword">Master Tactician</span> allows you to move dice around—all those are designed for a focused play style and set of tactics, so the full extent of what they can do aren’t obvious. There’s a lot of fruitful ground in making such Gifts.

# Mythender Moments

## Mythender Moments

Individual scenes and things that happen during the Mythender’s time are called <span class="keyword">moments</span>. Sometimes, a Mythender will want to do something, and together with the Mythmaster, they’ll paint the scene in everyone’s mind: what it looks and sounds like, who’s there, and what’s going on when the Mythender enters. Then that Mythender does what she wants, and rules are engaged, then the scene’s over.

Sometimes a Mythender will want to do something in the middle of a described scene, in which case we already know what it looks and sounds like, who’s there, and what’s going on.

That means Moments can be entire scenes unto themselves or pieces of a scene, all depending on the flow of play and what people are describing. That’s why these are called “moments”— they last as long or as short as they need to, and flow together as you need them.

### Core Moments in Time

Every Moment stems from one of two things: you’re possibly or certainly terrorizing mortals for Mythic Power, or you’re trying to heal the wounds in your soul by interacting with mortals.

**Terrorizing Mortals for Power**

Mythenders can terrorize mortals and get the very power than gods gain from doing this very thing. This can happen through inspiring fear or inspiring awe and reverence.

**Seeking Sympathy & Healing**

Mythenders need to bond with the very mortals who fear them, if they are to retain their humanity. But this is no sure thing.

### Other Moments in Time

These other Moments are variations on terrorizing or seeking healing, or are things you can do that may end up turning into one of those two events.

**Performing Badass, Epic Feats**

Mythenders can do some crazy-ass stuff: break mountains, carve rivers, cause the skies to darken or clear—and that’s just for starters.

**Helping Mortals**

Mythenders can help mortals, but doing so means straddling a line between normal, mortal helping and using your Mythic power to help.

**Slaughtering Mortals**

Slaughtering mortals is trivial to every Mythender, and it gives you power.

### Resting

Resting—where the Mythenders reset their Wounds and Weapon charges—happens when the Mythenders have a moment to relax, which is to say during their time. The rules for Resting are covered at the end of the Battle chapter (**End of the Battle**).

### Moments in Time Without Rules

Social conflicts—arguing with people and trying to sway them—are intentionally not a part of <span class="mythender">Mythender</span>’s rules. You can still have moments where you’re debating or arguing, but there’s no way to just get someone to peacefully agree with you. There are no rules to help with peace.

You can argue with a mortal and play out that discussion, but the only way you truly have to force a mortal to change their mind is to rip away their free will be Terrorizing Mortals for Power. You might bridge understanding and empathy through Seeking Sympathy and Healing, but that doesn’t mean you will win an argument with a mortal. Finally, you can argue with your fellow Mythenders, but the only way to force them to do anything is to Murder Another Mythender—and even then, you’re only forcing them to die.

You can also argue with a Myth about how it’s an abomination and should lay down its life, but that’s considered banter before a battle or a Wound during it.

Other Moments where you’re showing color about your Mythender, like saying your character is going off fishing for a bit to relax, aren’t handled by any rules.

#### Small Moments in Time

Moments like your character going to fish are considered small Moments, and might be worth turning into something where you explore more of the land, describing and embracing more about this Mythic World. A small Moment could also turn into a Moment of Seeking Sympathy and Healing, as you spend a quiet bit of time trying to bond with someone you’ve met.

But you don’t have to do that, if you don’t want to. Rules only get forced on you when you do dramatic and powerful actions.

That said, if your small Moment is boring, don’t bother playing it out. Say “Yeah, my guy is going fishing” and cut to the next thing that’s actually interesting, unless there’s more to your moment. And if there is more, you need to say so. “Yeah, my Mythender is going fishing, because he’s going to catch the King of Fish and demand his kind serve him.” (Performing a Badass, Epic Feat)

Or “Yeah, he’s going fishing because he wants to be alone, but there should totally be a mortal there that he can bond with.” (Seeking Sympathy and Healing)

## Terrorizing Mortals for Power

If the power you have gained from battle is not enough, you can rip power from mortals directly through awe and fear. You can do so directly, by demanding their worship and demonstrating the price for disobedience. You can do so indirectly, by performing a miracle that inspires abject servitude. You can even do so through kind acts, like healing the sick or rebuilding entire towns in mere moments.

### Frame the Moment

Tell the Mythmaster you want to terrorize mortals for power. He’ll ask you some questions, like “Where are you doing that?” or “Who’s there?” You’ll describe the moment for the table.

### Decide how you’re Terrorizing

You can terrorize mortals for power either by a dramatic act of Mythic will or violence, or you can use your Fate’s Power. Anything works as long as it assaults a mortal’s will, even acts of kindness fueled by Mythic power.

This might be a part of a **Badass, Epic Feat**, in which case you may also take advantage of those benefits.

### Play the Moment Out

Maybe the moment is quick, just needing a little description from you and the Mythmaster. Maybe the table would like to see it played out some. However you want to do it, have fun adding to the story of your Mythender being awesome and horrific!

Just remember, the rule is called “Terrorizing Mortals for Power,” not “Boring Everyone at the Table for Power.” That rule doesn’t exist.

### Push Corruption & Fate

#### Increase Your Corruption

Gain two <span class="keyword">Corruption</span> (see **Suffering Corruption**). You will change form as a result of this. Add that change into your description.

#### Roll the Mythic Die

Roll it! If the <span class="keyword">Mythic die</span> came up ![4](/catalog/creators/ryan-macklin/mythender/mythic-4.svg), ![5](/catalog/creators/ryan-macklin/mythender/mythic-5.svg), or ![6](/catalog/creators/ryan-macklin/mythender/mythic-6.svg), advance <span class="keyword">Fate</span> twice and gain two <span class="keyword">Gifts</span>. Otherwise, advance <span class="keyword">Fate</span> once and gain one Gift.

_Note_: If you have the <span class="keyword">Blaze of Glory</span> gift, just still roll one die. Gifts do not apply outside of Battle.

#### Gain Might

Gain <span class="keyword">Might tokens</span> equal to the number of Fate boxes you have checked (including the first one).

### Push Forward

With this done, move onto the next moment.

### Example

Olivia is in the Village of Norrsundet (**Mythic Norden**) and is disgusted by how the residents worship Jörmungandr with vile blood magic. She decides there’s no talking sense to them, so she’s just going to change their minds by showing she’s more powerful than the World Serpent. She doesn’t care that this will terrorize mortals and assault their free will; she’s in fact counting on that.

With her Weapon, <span class="keyword">Spirits of her Wise Ancestors</span>, she describes summoning all of her ancestors to torment the priests and acolytes of Jörmungandr, each one forcibly ripping the toxic blood from them and leaving them to die while the rest of the village watches. All the while, she stands in front of the temple, shouting to all that their beloved Myth is no match for her might, and none should bow to any evil beast.

Her Fate is to become the <span class="keyword">God of War</span> (with her own spin on it), and she’s currently at her Paragon Form: her shadow is in constant battle with everything around it, even when she it stilling still. The first two Corruptions boxes are checked, as is the first Fate box.

    Corruption
    ▷☒4 ▷☒4    Paragon: I appear as… My shadow is in constant battle even when I am still
          ▽
      ☒3◁ ☒3    Supernatural: I appear as… My warhorse and I leave steps of blood that lament
      ▽
      ☐2 ▷☐2    Godly: I appear as… A giant war-goddess made from the bodies of the slain

Because she’s Terrorizing for Power, she’ll check off the next two Fate boxes:

    Fate
    X •
    ☒ •
    ☒ •
    ☒ •
    ☐ 6
    ☐ 5
    ☐ 4
    ☐ 3
    ☐ 2

Now she’s in her Supernatural Form: her and her warhorse leave blood with each step that whispers lament, and her shadow continues to constantly battle.

After that change, she rolls the Mythic Die and gets a ![5](/catalog/creators/ryan-macklin/mythender/mythic-5.svg), so she advances her Fate twice. This means she has two more Gift slots available, to be filled in whenever she likes.

Since she now has four Fate boxes checked (including the first one), she gets 4 Might tokens.

After that, the Mythmaster describes how all those who witness this fall to their knees, renouncing their old god and begging their new one—Olivia—to remove the impurity in their bodies.

## Seeking Sympathy & Healing

If you want to heal your soul and back away from the brink of corrupt apotheosis, you need to approach a mortal and show them the person who you are underneath your godslaying paragon of power.

This is the hardest part of being a Mythender. You always succeed at doing amazing feats. Getting someone to treat you as a human being? Good fucking luck.

### Ask for a Sympathy Moment

The Mythmaster will frame a scene where you must deal with a mortal. Expect him to play hard and harsh. If you walk away from the scene he framed, there’s no second chance at sympathy.

The Mythmaster will tell you things your Mythender knows instantly, like this mortal’s name, family, what they’re thinking on the surface—all things a Mythender inherently knows about every mortal he or she sees. Ask whatever questions you wish. They will all be answered.

### Play the Moment to a Point

Build up the moment with some dialogue, maybe some soft action, until everyone feels like the question of “does this mortal see the inner me?” is relevant and should be answered.

### Gather Dice

Gather up to 3 dice, one for each questions you answer “yes” to:

- **Have the Mythenders refrained from terrorizing mortals for power so far?**
- **Did you try to understand the plight of this mortal?**
- **Did you make a serious effort to downplay or disregard your Mythic nature?**
- **Did you share yourself in a way that exposed emotional vulnerability?**

The Mythmaster and the rest of the table get to answer if these are true. If you gather no dice, you automatically fail.

### Roll Dice to Restrain your Nature

Once you have your dice, if any, roll them. If any come up ![5](/catalog/creators/ryan-macklin/mythender/storm-5.svg) or ![6](/catalog/creators/ryan-macklin/mythender/storm-6.svg), you succeed at restraining your Mythic nature. If none did, or you have no dice, you fail to do so.

#### If You Succeed

You’re able to keep your Mythic nature held back enough, and this mortal sees the person within.

#### If You Fail

Your Mythic power overwhelms the mortal, destroying his free will. He cannot see anything past the Mythic being in front of them. Perhaps he will swear eternal love and loyalty to you. Perhaps he will commit suicide in despair. But whatever he does, he’s now only a shell of a person, thanks to you.

#### In Either Case

Your Form softens—uncheck the lowest two Corruption boxes. You may now also give up Gift slots to reduce how close you are to apotheosis—you may give up any number (including zero!) that aren’t permanent. For each given up, reduce your Fate track by one. If there’s a Gift in a slot you’ve given up, that Gift is erased.

### Push Forward

With the moment done, for good or ill, move onto the next one.

### Permanent Corruption & Fate

If you have any Corruption and Fate boxes that have been made permanently checked (when you choose not to die in **Mythender Death & Making the Choice**), they can never be healed by mortal sympathy.

### Example

Rashid taxed himself greatly in the battle with the Frost Jötnar (**Jötnar, the Giants**), having four Corruption Boxes checked and looking like his Supernatural Fate: a massive fiery djinn with eyes that glow of eldritch power. (He made his own Fate, a God of Magic with an Arabian bent.) He is sure that he’ll fall and become Myth in the upcoming battle with Thor, so he seeks to calm his Mythic Heart.

When the Mythenders arrive at the Fort of Thorberge (**Some Cities & Towns**), he says he wants to Seek Sympathy and Healing, and wants to debate religion and belief with the mortals, one “man” to another. The Mythmaster describes how he encounters several mortals who die upon the sight of him, as he’s projecting so much Mythic power, before he encounters a blind sage. (These don’t count as Slaughtering Mortals, because Rashid’s player didn’t describe killing them. The Mythmaster did.)

The mortal, Kolgrímur, and he talk for a bit. Rashid apologies for their intrusion, and as they chat, Kolgrímur challenges Rashid’s belief in Allah. When that feels like it’s at an apex point, the Mythmaster calls for the roll.

Since no one has terrorized mortals yet (at least, not intentionally), Rashid starts with one die. The table decides that he did make a serious effort to downplay his Mythic nature—while without sight, the mortal could still tell he was speaking to a Mythender very close to falling, but Rashid sought to speak as a mortal. The table also decides that Rashid expressed vulnerability by allowing his own faith to be questioned and explored. That means two more dice, for a total of three. He rolls, and…

#### He Succeeds

Rashid rolls a ![4,](/catalog/creators/ryan-macklin/mythender/storm-4.svg) ![3,](/catalog/creators/ryan-macklin/mythender/storm-3.svg) ![5](/catalog/creators/ryan-macklin/mythender/storm-5.svg), giving him the one success he needs…barely. Kolgrímur gets up and thanks “Lord Rashid” for his time, and says he will reflect on the Mythender’s wisdom. Rashid’s Heart calms, and he turns back into his Paragon Form, as a man with eyes of eldritch power. They shake hands, and Rashid leaves.

#### He Fails

Rashid rolls a ![4,](/catalog/creators/ryan-macklin/mythender/storm-4.svg) ![3,](/catalog/creators/ryan-macklin/mythender/storm-3.svg) ![1](/catalog/creators/ryan-macklin/mythender/storm-1.svg), giving him no successes. While Rashid’s Heart calms and he turns back to his Paragon Form, he watches as the Mythic Power overwhelms the mortal. Rashid was not able to contain the power and save the man who saved him. Still, even in failing, his Heart calms…just as Kolgrímur coughs up blood and dies.

## Performing Badass, Epic Feats

Mythenders are incredible titans who can do amazing feats! Break mountains, change the course of rivers, control mortals—there’s little you cannot accomplish. But that power comes at a cost, for those feats are powered by your Mythic nature, and from there lies Corruption.

When you want to do an epic feat, answer the following:

### Is This Feat Mundane or Uninteresting?

Then don’t use these rules. It just happens, with no benefit or further effect.

### Is This Feat Inhumanly Possible?

Answer these questions:

- **Are you capable of this feat?**
- **If so, are you creating or destroying a Blight?**
- **Are you embracing or resisting Corruption?**

### Are you capable of this feat?

No Mythender is omnipotent; you each have limitations. You can accomplish an epic feat if it fits under one or more of these conditions:

- **It is _merely_ something that takes godly might, speed, skill, wit, etc.**
- **You can explain how your Weapons enable you to do this feat.**
- **You can justify it either directly or inspired by your Fate’s powers.**

In addition, if there’s a Blight that would prevent you from doing this, and the feat you’re doing isn’t attacking that Blight, you’re restrained from this action. At least, for the time being.

If you cannot do the feat because it doesn’t fit any of the above, don’t worry! Once you fall and become a Myth, you can totally do it.

If you can do the feat, then it is done, unquestioningly. You and the Mythmaster describe what happens.

### Are you creating or destroying a blight?

Epic actions can create or destroy Blights (**Creating a Blight** and **Destroying a Blight**). This is optional; not every epic action needs to deal with a Blight.

If creating a new Blight, pay <span class="keyword">2 Might tokens</span>, take a new Blight card and write its description down. Write your Mythender’s name on the “Created by” line. Finally, check off the first charge box and the Lasting box.

In lieu of creating a new Blight, you can bolster an existing Blight that you or another Mythender created. Rewrite the Blight’s description to reflect how its more powerful (if so inspired), then check off two more charge boxes.

If destroying a Blight, pay <span class="keyword">2 Might</span> and tear the card up.

You may only create or destroy one Blight if you’re resisting Corruption. If embracing Corruption, _you can create and destroy as many Blights as you can afford_. You can use the Might tokens gained from embracing Corruption to pay for them.

### Are you embracing or resisting Corruption?

The choice you have here is if you are trying to use Mythic power while attempting to resist its Corruption, hoping that it does not change you and make you closer to becoming a Myth; or you can embrace what the world of Myth wants you to become and gain power from it.

#### Embracing Corruption

If you are embracing Corruption, this is also **Terrorizing Mortals for Power**, even if you’re doing this in a “nice” way or for kind reasons. If there were no mortals in this moment to begin with, the Mythmaster will introduce some witness your horrific power. Do everything in those rules as well.

If this action assaults or removes a mortal’s free will, or violates the line between life and death, it is always embracing Corruption. That’s pretty inhuman.

#### Resisting Corruption

If you are attempting to resist Corruption, this is a risk. Grab two dice if the Mythmaster says there are no mortals to witness your act, or one if there are. (_Spoiler_: unless you are far, far away from any hint of civilization, there are mortal witnesses. Mortals are drawn to witnessing horrific power, and your Mythender will know their presence. Deal with it.)

_Reminder_: Companions don’t count as mortals, because they no longer have true free will.

Roll the dice. If either come up ![5](/catalog/creators/ryan-macklin/mythender/storm-5.svg) or ![6](/catalog/creators/ryan-macklin/mythender/storm-6.svg), you have resisted Myth’s corrupting influence! You’re unchanged. Otherwise, treat as the result of **Terrorizing Mortals for Power**, except you don’t roll the Mythic die—only claim 1 Might token and only suffer one Fate box. There is less reward if you resist your Mythic nature.

### Describe the Feat & Push Forward

You and the Mythmaster should describe what happens, based on Blights created or destroyed and how you handled Corruption. Once everyone at the table is satisfied with playing out that moment, move on.

### Limits to These Gains

While you can do incredible feats, you do not have limitless power. If you do a second feat during the same Mythender time, you may only gain a maximum of 2 Might token from it. After that, no additional Might gains. This resets after on your next Mythender time.

## Examples of Badass, Epic Feats

### Example: Resisting Corruption

Rashid wishes to put out a raging inferno consuming a town and surrounding forest, one started by fire giants in the prior battle. (<span class="keyword">Raging Inferno</span> is a persistent blight.) So he summons the very spirits of the fire and shove them back down into the deep earth.

Now, no one had mentioned anything about the fire having spirits before, but Rashid declared it and the Mythmaster knows better than to question him. Of course it’s fire spirits! And it’s interesting, so we proceed.

The feat’s inhumanly possible, all right. Qualifies for these rules. And Rashid is capable of this feat through his Relic Weapon, <span class="keyword">The Book of Dominion over Demons and Spirits</span>. No question about that. He’s focused on destroying the Blight, so that’s is taken care of.

All that remains is to see if he’s embracing or resisting Corruption. He could easily embrace it, shouting at fire spirits and making everyone in the town bow before his terrible awe. But no, he decides that mortals should keep their free will or some junk, and resists.

There are mortals around, so Rashid’s player picks up just 1 die.

#### Failing to Resist

He rolls it, getting a ![4](/catalog/creators/ryan-macklin/mythender/storm-4.svg)! Oh no! He failed to resist Corruption!

The Mythmaster takes over the narration, though Rashid still pays the 2 Might tokens to destroy the Blight. The Mythmaster describes the raging inferno turning into spirits, and as they all die down, some lash back with their final breathes to burn several villagers. The rest of the mortals bow to Rashid, He Who Controls Fire, and beg him for forgiveness against whatever transgressions they may have committed.

Rashid progresses is Fate by one box and gains 1 Might for causing this horror in the hearts of mortals.

#### Succeeding in Resisting

He rolls it, getting a ![5](/catalog/creators/ryan-macklin/mythender/storm-5.svg)! He successfully resists Corruption!

So he describes forcing the fire spirits into the deep earth, and the fire vanishing with it (and paying 2 Might tokens to do so). The people witnessing still bow before his terrible awe, but not in a “I accidentally destroyed your free will while trying to help” way.

### Example: Embracing Corruption

Unna arrives at a village after some monsters have already slaughtered many of its people. So she figures, hey, why not just bring them back?

That certainly isn’t boring. Her Fate is Death, so that fits with her Fate’s Power: <span class="keyword">Slaughter mortals with my will, raise the dead, summon shades of the deceased</span>. There’s no Blight in play that’s she’s destroying—there are no such thing as passive Blights like “people are dead.” She also doesn’t really care about creating one, though she could make one like “my loyal risen army” or the like. But that’s not Unna’s point. She just wants some dead people to be…less dead.

As for Corruption, her player says “Bring it on!” because Corruption is sexy, and also gives you sweet, sweet Mythic power. Sure, it’ll mean that the mortals she’s bringing back to life will have their free will destroyed, but them’s the breaks, I guess. (Of course, since this is automatically something that terrifies mortals, she doesn’t have a choice here, but if doesn’t stop her from being enthusiastic about it.)

The rest of this example is covered in **Terrorizing Mortals for Power**, since Unna’s embracing Corruption.

### Example: Not Bothering With These Rules

After the battle against giant scorpion-men, Erik the Hated jumps from one side of a chasm to the other, in order to retrieve his sword, <span class="keyword">Viperbane</span>. The scorpion-general knocked it out of his hands as its last action, as it was being totally ended. Since there’s nothing interesting going on, just a bit of color to show how casually Erik gets his sword back, none of the **Epic, Badass Feats** rules are used.

Now, if Erik’s player wanted to make a big deal about it, he could push it further—by, for example, describing closing the chasm with his will—but he just wanted to say “Yeah, I just wanted to describe how I got my sword back. Let’s move on.” Everyone’s happy.

## Helping Mortals

There are two ways to help mortals: helping them as a normal person and helping them by using your crazy Mythic power.

If you’re helping like a normal person—patching them up with bandages, rebuilding a home with your bare hands, or using other mortal means—that’s **Seeking Sympathy & Healing** (page 174). Or it’s just a moment of color that doesn’t require invoking those rules.

If you’re using your power to go far beyond mortal means, especially for things like changing minds and memory or tackling sickness and death, that’s definitely **Terrorizing Mortals for Power**. And you have to go through those rules.

### The Line

You might want to help people like a normal person, like rebuilding a castle wall that you destroyed during the last battle when you caused a column of fire to come forth from the heavens. But you have this pesky superhuman strength that makes you worry that you’ll terrorize mortals by moving bricks around. So what’s a godkiller to do?

This is the line between “as a normal person” and “crazy Mythic power.” Each group will feel it differently, but the gist is: if you’re not showing off and are genuinely trying to help someone with near-normal means, it’s possibly **Seeking Sympathy & Healing**. And when the answer to the question “Is the Mythender putting aside her Mythic nature?” is definitely “no”—it’s **Terrorizing Mortals for Power**.

### Healing Mortals

To be absolutely clear to the point of repetition, if you use Mythic power to heal the bodies or minds of mortals, or you raise the dead, that’s **Terrorizing Mortals for Power**. No matter how grateful a mortal is, that is an vulgar, unnatural act of the highest degree, and an assault of their will.

### Trying to Make Small Changes

If you’re deliberately _trying_ to do something that a mortal can do, without putting your will into it, you might succeed. What happens is entirely up to the Mythmaster’s whim! Perhaps you’re trying to break a child’s fever by using local herbs, rather than just willing the child better with your dominion over life. You’re putting your hope and faith before your will, which means you have no control over the outcome.

Of course, such a thing is a good catalyst for a Seeking Sympathy and Healing moment. Or perhaps a moment to explore more of the Mythic World as you go out to get those herbs from a forest dangerous to mortals.

## Slaughtering Mortals

Every Mythender can slaughter mortals. Period. No contest. There’s no die roll to see if you do it or not. Just describe it. Every mortal around you lives purely by your will.

When you choose to do this, it totally counts as **Terrorizing Mortals for Power**.

Know that every single mortal knows that you hold the power of death in your hands and can with the most trivial acts end their lives. They know this in their very souls. Even those who would defy a Mythender know that they are probably going to die for that act of defiance.

Is it any wonder that so many grovel and kneel to a Mythender as they would a god? And, really, is there much of a difference?

### Why Would I Do This?

Some people read this section and wonder why a Mythender would do this to mortals. Some Mythenders believe in the sanctity of mortalkind, and others don’t give two shits about a mortal that refuses to fall in line.

But those are extremes. Maybe you’ll narrate your Mythender accidentally killing a bunch of mortals, which still counts as Terrorizing for Power, if you’re just freeform narrating that it’s an accident.

_Note_: It doesn’t count as Terrorizing if mortals die because you failed to resist Corruption in a Badass, Epic Feat or in Seeking Sympathy and Healing, though mortals are likely to still die at the Mythmaster’s whim. It only counts when you, the player, decide that it happens.

In any case, slaughtering mortals always an option, and shows the power you have over others.

## Moments in Brief

##### Terrorizing Mortals for Power

Describe terrorizing the mortals. Gain two Corruption, the roll the Mythic die. If it comes up ![4](/catalog/creators/ryan-macklin/mythender/mythic-4.svg), ![5](/catalog/creators/ryan-macklin/mythender/mythic-5.svg), or ![6](/catalog/creators/ryan-macklin/mythender/mythic-6.svg), advance Fate twice. Otherwise, advance Fate once. Gain Might tokens equal to the number of Fate boxes you have checked (including the first one and the ones you’ve just now checked).

##### Seeking Sympathy & Healing

Describe how you’re trying to bond with a mortal. Then the table answers these questions:

- Have the Mythenders refrained from terrorizing mortals for power so far?
- Did you try to understand the plight of this mortal?
- Did you make a serious effort to downplay or disregard your Mythic nature?
- Did you share yourself in a way that exposed emotional vulnerability?

Gain up to 3 dice, one for each question answered “yes.” Roll them. If any come up a ![5](/catalog/creators/ryan-macklin/mythender/storm-5.svg) or ![6](/catalog/creators/ryan-macklin/mythender/storm-6.svg), you contain your Mythic nature and keep from destroying this mortal. Otherwise, the mortal dies or has their free will annihilated.

Either way, uncheck your lowest two Corruption boxes, and reduce as many Gifts and Fate track as you like (including none), though you must keep the first one.

##### Performing Badass, Epic Feats

First, make sure you can do the feat. It has to be something a Mythender can generally do, something a Weapon lets you do, or something your Fate’s powers let you do.

Then decide if you’re creating or destroying a Blight. Doing either costs 2 Might tokens.

Finally, are you embracing or resisting Corruption? If you’re embracing Corruption, then it’s also Terrorizing Mortals for Power. And you can create or destroy as many Blights as you can afford (including from the Might tokens you gain in this action).

If you’re resisting Corruption, then you can only create or destroy one Blight. Then roll to see if you resist Corruption. Grab 2 dice if no mortals witness the event, or 1 if even a single mortal does. If either die comes up ![5](/catalog/creators/ryan-macklin/mythender/storm-5.svg) or ![6](/catalog/creators/ryan-macklin/mythender/storm-6.svg), you’ve resisted Corruption. If not, treat it as Terrorizing Mortals for Power, except you only get 1 Might token, and the Mythmaster has license to make your feat particularly nasty.

##### Helping Mortals

You can help mortals. If you’re doing so in a normal, human way, then it’s either a quick moment of color or **Seeking Sympathy & Healing**. If you’re using your Mythic abilities to help mortals, it’s **Terrorizing Mortals for Power**.

##### Slaughtering Mortals

You can, period. If you choose to describe this, it counts as Terrorizing Mortals for Power. If it comes from failing to resist Corruption in a **Badass, Epic Feat** or in **Seeking Sympathy & Healing**, it doesn’t count as **Terrorizing Mortals for Power**.

# Murdering One Another

## Murdering Another Mythender

Sometimes a Mythender just has to die. When another Mythender decides that, murder is quick to follow, and at least one Mythender is sure to die.

### Murder Interrupts Almost Everything

Murdering another Mythender trumps nearly all other actions, _even in battle_. If you do something and someone else decides to kill you over it, you have to live to have your thing happen. The only things that Murder cannot interrupt: once dice are rolled for anything, you must Push Forward; and once a Myth is Ended, you cannot Murder until the aftermath is done (so no killing your friend who is about to Fall, unless you do it before you End the Myth.)

### Who is involved

At least two people are involved, the Mythender starting the violence and the one she wants to kill. Others may get involved, if they want.

### Use Bonds & Gather Dice

Mythenders start with 3 dice. They can break a <span class="keyword">Bond</span> (**Bonding to the Others**) they have with someone else in the Murder, and gain 2 more dice. You must show how, with rage or calm, this Bond has been broken. Alternatively, show it breaking with regret as you’re are forced to fight the person who you have this Bond with.

If you break a Bond, gain 2 more dice and describe how your Mythender feels. When you break a Bond, strike it off the Bonds sheet, preferably in a dramatic fashion.

### Roll Dice & Count Successes

Once everyone has their dice, roll them! ![4,](/catalog/creators/ryan-macklin/mythender/storm-4.svg) ![5,](/catalog/creators/ryan-macklin/mythender/storm-5.svg) ![and 6](/catalog/creators/ryan-macklin/mythender/storm-6.svg) are successes. There is nothing that can change this roll; <span class="keyword">Gifts</span> don’t apply to Murder.

### Someone Dies, Maybe Everyone

#### If Only Two Mythenders are Involved

Whichever Mythender rolled fewer successes dies. _In the case of a tie, both die_.

#### If More Than Two are Involved

If two or more tie for the most successes, everyone who acted (rolled dice) in the murder dies. _Everyone_. Otherwise, whoever has the most successes decides which Mythenders involved live and die. At least one Mythender must die.

### Push Forward

Murder is quick and bloody. The winner describes the aftermath. The others can describe elements of their final moments, but to the victor go the rights to narrate.

### No Coming Back

There is no coming back from Murder. You cannot be revived by another Mythender using her Fate’s power. Mythenders killed by another Mythender are forever peacefully dead.

### Optional: Sharing

If there are more that two Mythenders involved, one can give half of their dice (round down) _before rolling_ to help another Mythender. Describe how you’re aiding.

### Example

Tzofiya and Unna are in a mortal town set near the base of Yggdrasil. Their battle with einherjar (**Mythic Norden**) caused a Blight—<span class="keyword">a river of fire</span>—that tore through the town and killed many of its people. Unna sees the burned corpses, the survivors who are weeping, and feels guilt for her involvement in this tragedy. So she, as Fated to be the God of Death, declares she’s bringing them back to life.

Tzofiya stops her, trying to talk her out of this, as what she’s doing is as much of an abomination as the Myths they fight. Unna’s guilt is not eased by this, and she continues with her description.

Lily, Tzofiya’s player, says “I kill her.”

Once declared, it’s time to go to dice. They know they’ll describe what happens once the dice are rolled. Tzofiya and Unna each start with 3 dice.

Tzofiya has a bond with Unna, <span class="keyword">Unna shows me the worth of mortals</span>. She describes breaking this bond by saying “Unna is violating the very thing that she has shown me, and it breaks my heart.” She gets 2 more dice, for a total of 5.

Unna likewise has a bond with Tzofiya, <span class="keyword">Tzofiya accepts all of me</span>. Clearly, Tzofiya no longer accepts all of her, so she describes the anger at this betrayal. She gets 2 more dice, for a total of 5.

They roll their dice…

#### Tzofiya Wins

Tzofiya gets ![4,](/catalog/creators/ryan-macklin/mythender/storm-4.svg) ![5,](/catalog/creators/ryan-macklin/mythender/storm-5.svg) ![3,](/catalog/creators/ryan-macklin/mythender/storm-3.svg) ![6,](/catalog/creators/ryan-macklin/mythender/storm-6.svg) ![and 2](/catalog/creators/ryan-macklin/mythender/storm-2.svg) and Unna gets ![5,](/catalog/creators/ryan-macklin/mythender/storm-5.svg) ![2,](/catalog/creators/ryan-macklin/mythender/storm-2.svg) ![1,](/catalog/creators/ryan-macklin/mythender/storm-1.svg) ![4,](/catalog/creators/ryan-macklin/mythender/storm-4.svg) ![and 3](/catalog/creators/ryan-macklin/mythender/storm-3.svg). That means Tzofiya has 3 successes to Unna’s 2.

Tzofiya describes how she stops Unna from raising the dead by slamming her blade into Unna’s back, turning it once to break her spine, and letting her body go slump. Unna is a Mythender no more.

#### Unna Wins

Tzofiya gets ![5,](/catalog/creators/ryan-macklin/mythender/storm-5.svg) ![1,](/catalog/creators/ryan-macklin/mythender/storm-1.svg) ![2,](/catalog/creators/ryan-macklin/mythender/storm-2.svg) ![3,](/catalog/creators/ryan-macklin/mythender/storm-3.svg) ![and 4](/catalog/creators/ryan-macklin/mythender/storm-4.svg) and Unna gets ![4,](/catalog/creators/ryan-macklin/mythender/storm-4.svg) ![5,](/catalog/creators/ryan-macklin/mythender/storm-5.svg) ![6,](/catalog/creators/ryan-macklin/mythender/storm-6.svg) ![6,](/catalog/creators/ryan-macklin/mythender/storm-6.svg) ![and 4](/catalog/creators/ryan-macklin/mythender/storm-4.svg). That means Tzofiya has 2 successes to Unna’s 5.

Unna describes how she defends herself by using the power of Death, killing Tzofiya in doing so by ripping the life force from her throat. She uses this potent life force to reanimate the townsfolk. Unna could not help but kill Tzofiya, as that is fated once Mythenders turn on one another.

#### They Tie

Tzofiya gets ![3,](/catalog/creators/ryan-macklin/mythender/storm-3.svg) ![4,](/catalog/creators/ryan-macklin/mythender/storm-4.svg) ![5,](/catalog/creators/ryan-macklin/mythender/storm-5.svg) ![5,](/catalog/creators/ryan-macklin/mythender/storm-5.svg) ![and 1](/catalog/creators/ryan-macklin/mythender/storm-1.svg) and Unna gets ![4,](/catalog/creators/ryan-macklin/mythender/storm-4.svg) ![1,](/catalog/creators/ryan-macklin/mythender/storm-1.svg) ![6,](/catalog/creators/ryan-macklin/mythender/storm-6.svg) ![5,](/catalog/creators/ryan-macklin/mythender/storm-5.svg) ![and 1](/catalog/creators/ryan-macklin/mythender/storm-1.svg). That means both of them have 3 successes.

Together, they describe how they kill each other. Tzofiya’s sword bites into Unna’s body, shattering her spine and spraying blood, while Unna grabs Tzofiya’s neck and rips the life from her. They are both dead. Time for new characters!

## What Happens Afterward

With one or more Mythender slain, the group now has to decide how to proceed. Maybe interest in the game is lost, or that moment is the real climax of the adventure, so that story is over. Or you want to progress, making new Mythenders who immediately join up the cause to End the Myth that brought these Mythenders here.

If you make new characters, remember that Mythenders are nearly omniscient. The living Mythenders will know instantly that these new characters have become Mythenders, ready to get some deicide on. The new Mythenders will know what they are and the nature of the other Mythenders, dead and alive. (See **When Mythenders Die & Fall** for more on creating Mythenders after dying mid-adventure.)

### Example

Drawing from the previous example, Lily and Nora’s Mythenders slaughter each other, and they want to keep playing because they relish the opportunity to play the characters who just became Mythenders thanks to their old ones.

Since they have experience making characters and there’s another player and Mythmaster waiting on them, they just spend a few minutes fleshing out Weapons, Forms, and a sense of personality. Then they describe the scene where their mortal hearts die and their Mythic Hearts come alive. Nora makes a Mythender who was raised from the dead by her old one, a <span class="keyword">Warrior Abomination of Death</span>. Lily makes one lost her whole family thanks to the <span class="keyword">River of Fire</span> Blight, a <span class="keyword">Crusader Mourner of Life</span>.

Rashid waits patiently for the two new Mythenders to join him. “Shall we?”

They nod. It’s time to End a motherfucking god.

# Corruption & Fate

## Corruption & Forms

As Mythenders take on Mythic Power, they gain <span class="keyword">Corruption</span>—the physical manifestation of that power. This Corruption twists and changes your physical form to become more like the god you’re fated to become, and as it does so, it makes it harder for you to resist the eroding of your mortal soul.

### Suffering Corruption

Corruption is tracked each time Mythic power is used. When the rules demand you suffer Corruption, you’ll check more Corruption boxes, as detailed in **Suffering Corruption**. This happens when you:

- **Perform a Badass, Epic Feat** and either embrace or fail to resist Corruption
- **Terrorize Mortals for Power**
- Make a **Mythic Action** or **Titanic Action** in battle
- Choose to **Survive Death** in battle

### Healing Corruption

By **Seeking Sympathy & Healing**, you will heal some of your Corruption.

### Corruption & Your Form

As you push more and more Corruption, your physical <span class="keyword">Form</span> changes. These Forms are linked not only to your body, but to how mortals perceive you as a Mythic being. The more godlike your form, the more unable they are to handle your presence. They may swear undying love to you as you progress, or even die at the sight of you.

These Forms were creating during **Damning Your Mythender** in character creation.

If you have zero or one Corruption box checked, you appear as you normally do, your <span class="keyword">Mortal Form</span>.

Once you have two Corruption boxes checked, you appear as your <span class="keyword">Paragon Form</span>, transforming in that instant.

At four Corruption boxes checked, you appear as your <span class="keyword">Supernatural Form</span>.

When all six Corruption boxes are checked, you appear as your <span class="keyword">Godly Form</span>.

These Forms don’t change how you act. You retain all free will so long as you have any mortal soul—that is, up to the point where you become a Myth.

    → ☒ 4 → ☒ 4    Paragon: I appear as…  My shadow is in constant battle even when I am still
             ↓
      ☐ 3 ← ☒ 3    Supernatural: I appear as… My warhorse and I leave steps of blood that lament
       ↓
      ☐ 2 → ☐ 2    Godly: I appear as… A giant war-goddess made from the bodies of the slain

_Olivia currently appears as her Paragon Form: a shadow that is in constant battle, even when she is still. If she checks off another box, she’ll change to her Supernatural Form.</figcaption>_

**_Olivia currently appears as her Paragon Form: a shadow that is in constant battle, even when she is still. If she checks off another box, she’ll change to her Supernatural Form._**

### Corruption Numbers

The numbers in each Corruption box refers to **Risking & Suffering Fate**, and indicate how difficult it is to resist losing part of your mortal nature.

When the Mythic die is rolled, that number is compared to your <span class="keyword">Corruption number</span>. If the die is that number or higher, you cannot resist that small loss of mortality and gain of Mythic power.

    → ☒ 4 → ☐ 4
             ↓
      ☐ 3 ← ☐ 3
       ↓
      ☐ 2 → ☐ 2

_checking first box, Corruption number 4_

#### Corruption Number Example

Beatrice suffers Corruption for the first time in this adventure, as she describes a Mythic action in battle and takes up the Mythic die. So she checks off the first Corruption box. The number next to that box is 4, so when she’s resolving **Risking & Suffering Fate**, she’ll compare the Mythic die to her current Corruption number of 4.

The next time she suffers Corruption, her number will still be 4. The third time, it’ll be 3, and so on. If you run out of Corruption boxes to check off, your Corruption number stays at 2.

</div>

    → ☒ 4 → ☒ 4
             ↓
      ☐ 3 ← ☐ 3
       ↓
      ☐ 2 → ☐ 2

_checking second box, still Corruption number 4_

    → ☒ 4 → ☒ 4
             ↓
      ☐ 3 ← ☒ 3
       ↓
      ☐ 2 → ☐ 2

_checking third box, Corruption number 3_

    → ☒ 4 → ☒ 4
             ↓
      ☒ 3 ← ☒ 3
       ↓
      ☒ 2 → ☐ 2

_checking fifth box, Corruption number 2_

## Suffering Corruption

When you suffer Corruption, you check off Corruption boxes and possibly change your Form.

In Battle, you’ll check off one Corruption box, starting with the box in the top-left and following the arrows down.

    → ☒ 4 → ☐ 4
             ↓
      ☐ 3 ← ☐ 3
       ↓
      ☐ 2 → ☐ 2

_checking the first box_

    → ☒ 4 → ☒ 4
             ↓
      ☐ 3 ← ☐ 3
       ↓
      ☐ 2 → ☐ 2

_checking the second box_

    → ☒ 4 → ☒ 4
             ↓
      ☐ 3 ← ☒ 3
       ↓
      ☐ 2 → ☐ 2

_checking the third box_

Outside of Battle (Badass, Epic Feats and Terrorizing Mortals for Power), you’ll check off two Corruption boxes, which means you’ll definitely change form (see below).

    → ☒ 4 → ☒ 4
             ↓
      ☐ 3 ← ☐ 3
       ↓
      ☐ 2 → ☐ 2

_checking first & second boxes_

    → ☒ 4 → ☒ 4
             ↓
      ☐ 3 ← ☒ 3
      ↓
      ☐ 2 → ☐ 2

_checking second & third boxes_

    → ☒ 4 → ☒ 4
             ↓
      ☒ 3 ← ☒ 3
       ↓
      ☒ 2 → ☐ 2

_checking fourth & fifth boxes_

If you have all six boxes checked, your Form is as corrupted as your Mythic Heart can make it—you already appear as a god! If you have five boxes checked and are required to check two more, you’ll only check the sixth box.

### When You Suffer & Change

If you checked the second box on a given row, you’ll change form (as per **Corruption & Your Form**). When this happens, describe how the transformation takes effect.

### Forms & Starting Thunder Dice

The Form you are in when you start a battle determines your starting Thunder dice, as that Corruption allows more raw energy to surge through you, to help you survive against gods.

- <span class="keyword">Mortal Form</span>: 1 Thunder die
- <span class="keyword">Paragon Form</span>: 2 Thunder dice
- <span class="keyword">Supernatural Form</span>: 4 Thunder dice
- <span class="keyword">Godly Form</span>: 6 Thunder dice

## Healing Corruption

When you heal Corruption, you erase checks you’ve made earlier in the adventure. You’ll always heal two boxes. You will heal the most recent boxes first, going up.

    → ☒ 4 → ☒ 4           → ☒ 4 → ☐ 4
             ↓                     ↓
      ☐ 3 ← ☒ 3      →      ☐ 3 ← ☐ 3
       ↓                     ↓
      ☐ 2 → ☐ 2             ☐ 2 → ☐ 2

_healing third & second boxes_

If you have only one box checked, you’ll only heal that one box. If you have no boxes checked, you don’t heal; you don’t need it!

    → ☒ 4 → ☐ 4           → ☐ 4 → ☐ 4
             ↓                     ↓
      ☐ 3 ← ☐ 3      →      ☐ 3 ← ☐ 3
       ↓                     ↓
      ☐ 2 → ☐ 2             ☐ 2 → ☐ 2

_healing just the first box_

### Permanent Corruption

If you have any permanent Corruption boxes (**Permanent Corruption & Fate**), they will never heal.

    →(☒)4 →(☒)4           →(☒)4 →(☒)4
             ↓                     ↓
      ☐ 3 ← ☒ 3      →      ☐ 3 ← ☐ 3
       ↓                      ↓
      ☐ 2 → ☐ 2             ☐ 2 → ☐ 2

_healing just the third box, since the first two are permanent_

### When You Heal

Because you’re unchecking Corruption boxes, your Form reverts back one step: from Godly to Supernatural, Supernatural to Paragon, or Paragon to Mortal. When this happens, describe how the transformation takes effect. (Naturally, there’s no reverting if you were already in your Mortal Form.)

## Mythic Fate & Gifts

While Corruption is the physical manifestation of Mythic Power, <span class="keyword">Fate</span> is the metaphysical scar that power leaves on you. It measures how close you are to becoming the god you’re fated to be.

### Risking & Suffering Fate

Fate is tracked when you use Mythic power. In battle, it is risked, meaning that you may or may not suffer Fate. Outside of battle, when you channel Mythic Power, you will definitely suffer Fate.

When the rules demand you suffer Fate, you’ll check more Fate boxes, as detailed in Suffering Fate (**Risking & Suffering Fate**). As with Corruption, this happens when you:

- **Perform a Badass, Epic Feat** and either embrace or fail to resist Corruption
- **Terrorize Mortals for Power**
- Make a **Mythic Action** or **Titanic Action** in battle
- Choose to **Survive Death** in battle

### Healing Fate

By **Seeking Sympathy & Healing**, you _may choose to_ heal some of your Fate.

### Fate & your Soul

As you check off more Fate boxes, you’re letting the Mythic World have more and more of a handle on your mortal nature. At first, it is resisted easily, but as you lose more, you open yourself up to becoming a Myth.

If taken too far, you will **Become a Myth**.

### Gifts from your Mythic Heart

The upside to losing your mortality? Getting power! With each step down the path to apotheosis, you gain from your Mythic Heart a Gift: a way that, in battle, you are superior to other Mythenders and more of a match for Myths, using their dirty tricks against them.

These Gifts (found in the **Your Heart’s Gifts** chapter) give you access to new rules that break how battle normally works. The Myths have many of these. You might want some as well.

#### The First Gift Slot

Your Heart, chosen at Mythender Creation, gives you your first Gift. This is written in the top Gift slot. This Gift will never go away; it is the base power you have as a Mythender.

## Risking & Suffering Fate

Whenever you suffer Corruption, you’ll also either risk or suffer your Fate progressing toward your Mythic end.

Before you consult these rules, make sure you’ve already dealt with whatever Corruption you caused due to this action. That will impact how you do things here, if your Corruption number changes.

### Risking Fate

When you do a Mythic or Titanic Action in battle (**Scales of Action**), you’ll risk suffering your Fate. (See **Suffer Corruption & Risk Fate**).

In short, if the Mythic Die you rolled is equal to or higher than your Corruption Number (which may have changed based on the Corruption you just took), you must suffer Fate. Otherwise, you have the choice whether you wish to suffer Fate or hold back from it.

### Suffering Fate

When you suffer Fate, you’ll check off one or two Fate boxes, depending on which rule is causing you to suffer Fate. (**Terrorizing Mortals for Power** can cause two boxes to be checked; otherwise, check one box.)

### Fate & Apotheosis Number

Some Fate boxes have numbers next to them. These are <span class="keyword">Apotheosis numbers</span>. When these are checked, at the end of this battle (or the next one, if you checked this outside of battle), you’ll have to deal with possibly becoming a god.

That’s covered in **Becoming a Myth**.

### Gaining Gift Slots

    Fate GIFTS         Might Cost
     X • Bloodlust       2
     ☒ • Grievous Harm   2

If you checked off any Fate boxes, then you gain Gifts! Each blank Gift slot next to a checked Fate box is available for placing a new Gift. Write the name of the Gift and its Might cost in the boxes to the right of the Fate box.

When you have a Gift Slot open, you may pick a new Gift or upgrade an existing Gift you have. _You may take a Gift in this slot at any time, not just right when you acquire the slot._ If you choose one right now, you may immediately take benefit from it (if you pay the Might cost) before you Push Forward.

Read the chapter on Gifts (**Your Heart’s Gifts**) for more information, as well as the list of Gifts and upgrades you may choose from.

### If you’re out of Fate boxes

If you cannot check any more Fate boxes, then there is no further benefit or cost to your action. Also, you’re pretty much going to become a god soon, as that means your Apotheosis number is 2. If you’re told to check off two boxes, and you only have one left, you only check that last box off.

## Healing Fate

When you choose to heal Fate, you erase checks you’ve made earlier in the adventure. You’ll erase the check in the most recent Fate box and the Gift written in that slot, if any.

     ☒ • ______  →  ☒ • ______
     ☒ • ______     ☐ • ______

_healing a Fate box_

You never have to heal your Fate when you **Seek Sympathy & Healing**. That’s an option, if you’re willing to give up the Gift on that Fate track.

As with permanent Corruption, you cannot heal permanent Fate.

    (☒)• ______  → (☒)• ______
     ☐ • ______     ☐ • ______

_unable to heal a permanent Fate box_

### Healing & Losing Gifts

When you heal a Fate box, you lose the Gift slot linked to it. If you wrote a Gift in that slot, erase it. See **Losing Gifts** for more details.

Should you suffer Fate later in this adventure, you may choose the same or a different Gift for your newly re-opened Gift slot.

## Permanent Corruption & Fate

When you die in battle and make the choice to come back to life (**Mythender Death & Making the Choice**), you gain <span class="keyword">permanent Corruption</span> and <span class="keyword">permanent Fate</span>.

Permanent Corruption and permanent Fate can never be healed away. Once gained, they exist on you until you die or become a god. These permanent boxes are noted with circles around them.

### Marking Permanence

    → ☒ 4 → ☐ 4
         ↓
    →(☒)4 → ☒ 4

_first permanent Corruption_

Start marking permanent Corruption and permanent Fate at the top of each track.

If you have not yet gained permanent Corruption and Fate, then circle the mark you made around the top-left Corruption box and the first Fate box. If you already have permanent Corruption and Fate, then you’ll progress to the next respective boxes, just as you do during normal progression.

Unless all of the boxes on a track are already permanent, you should be circling a box. It may be the box you also just checked off.

When **Seeking Sympathy & Healing**, you cannot heal away permanent Corruption and Fate. Now those will never go away. Nor will they go away once an adventure is complete and you start a new one; you’ll instead start with your current permanent Corruption and Fate.

### First Permanent Fate Box

Every Mythender starts with the first the first Fate box permanently checked. It always counts as checked, including for determining many Might tokens are gained from **Terrorizing Mortals for Power** and Lightning tokens gained from <span class="keyword">Channeled Hatred</span> Gift (**Your Heart’s Gifts**).

## Becoming a Myth

When a battle is over, if you still live and you have any Fate boxes with an Apotheosis number checked, you will have to see if you become a Myth.

    Fate    Fate    Fate    Fate    Fate    Fate
    X •     X •     X •     X •     X •     X •

    ☐ 6     ☒ 6     ☒ 6     ☒ 6     ☒ 6     ☒ 6
    ☐ 5     ☐ 5     ☒ 5     ☒ 5     ☒ 5     ☒ 5
    ☐ 4     ☐ 4     ☐ 4     ☒ 4     ☒ 4     ☒ 4
    ☐ 3     ☐ 3     ☐ 3     ☐ 3     ☒ 3     ☒ 3
    ☐ 2     ☐ 2     ☐ 2     ☐ 2     ☐ 2     ☒ 2

_Fate tracks with Apotheosis numbers checked: none, 6, 5, 4, 3, and 2_

The first example shows a Mythender that is safe from apotheosis. The others show increasing danger of it happening.

### Checking for Apotheosis

Roll a die to see if your Mythic Heart has won this internal battle—the Mythic Die is appropriate, but no rules involving the Mythic Die are triggered. If the die is equal to or higher than the Apotheosis number, then you have become a Myth. Welcome!

If not, you are safe…for now.

And if you are safe, you cannot choose to become a Myth. Your Mythic Heart isn’t strong enough to consume you…yet.

### What Happens When you Become a Myth

The moment you do, the Mythic World whisks its newborn deity away to save it from the other Mythenders. This cannot be stopped—it would be a really boring story if it did.

You should describe this final transformation and disappearance, and the others should describe their reactions. Feel free to have a few parting words as the last of your mortality is burned away, or a few parting words as the new Myth.

Your Weapons, including Companions, are swept up in the raw power and becomes part of your Myth. Though, you can break this rule to link a new Mythender to an old one: a single Companion may be spared if he or she is to become a new Mythender because of this, or a new Mythender finds one of your fallen Mythender’s Relics.

### The Myth You Become

There are two general options for the Myth you become. The obvious is the one linked to in your Fate, but you can also become the new incarnation of the god you just Ended, only more badass because the new model is always better than the old one.

Either way, if you’re going to play again, the Mythmaster should create a new god to use, taking inspiration and direction from the existing write-ups in the Mythic Norden chapter. But don’t do that right away. Savor this moment of story.

### Example

Yolen, a simple farmer turned into a Mythender (a <span class="keyword">Mourner Bearer of Life</span>) has fought well against Thor, Ending him by stabbing him in the face with his heirloom war hammer. In this battle, he suffered Fate and checked off his 5 Fate box.

He rolls the Mythic die, and gets a ![5](/catalog/creators/ryan-macklin/mythender/mythic-5.svg). Yolen is no more!

Yolen’s player, Tyler, decides that Yolen should replace Thor—there should always be a Thor, he says—but one with a God of Life bent to him. That’s enough for now; if they play again, the Mythmaster can create this new Thor.

He describes picking up Thor’s hammer, Mjölnir, and as he does, his heart bursts out of his chest. But instead of blood flowing out, vines crawl and form all over his body, shaping him to be Thor with armor of the forest rather than of metal.

Rashid and Beatrice, his two fellow Mythenders, look on in sadness. Beatrice screams “No!” Yolen just looks back, his eyes echoing the same sadness, the last act of his mortal life.

Then lightning strikes, blinding all for a moment. When their vision regains, Yolen is gone.

# Mythic Norden

## The World of Mythic Norden

<span class="keyword">Mythic Norden</span> is a vast realm in the far, frozen North. It is the domain of the gods of order: Odin the Allfather and his kin, Thor of Thunder, Freyja of Love, Týr of War, and so on. It is the domain of gods of chaos: Loki and his children, Fenrir the Wolf, Jörmungandr the World Serpent, and so many other abominations. It’s the domain of countless other creatures, from dwarves and frost giants to valkyries and einherjar.

Even more, Norden is a land that lives and breathes. Its gods, its vast Myths, are extensions of its will and desire. The true horror of Norden is that its very essence all around you—omnipresent and forever watching.

### A Land of Eternal Winter

Norden is a place where the sun never melts away the frost, unless the mortals of a village show sufficient devotion. It strangles the land until its demands are met. When they are not, unrelenting storms roll in.

Even when the mortals capitulate, the spirits that make up the land and sky do not always listen. They love to play with mortals, to hear their wails and cries. This pleases Norden as well, for that makes mortals prostrate harder to its gods, praying for reprieve from the horrors they live every day.

### A Land of Endless Danger

In every forest, every plain, and even in the ground underneath, monsters lurk. The mortals of Norden tell stories to their children to keep them from wandering into darkness. These monsters make mortals fear, giving power to this Mythic World. And they keep mortals from journeying far, thus trapping them under Norden’s thumb.

### A Land So Very Hungry

While Norden’s gods don’t wish to be unmade, Norden has other plans. It uses its Myths to constantly attack Mythenders. It uses the connection to each Mythender’s Mythic Heart to drive dreams into their minds. It does not seek to kill Mythenders, but to take them, to consume them, to turn them into new gods under its will.

And every time a Mythender Falls into Myth, Norden grows stronger. Norden gains a god with vast power, one greater than the god it had before.

### This is not Historic Scandinavia

A note for scholars of Norse mythology and medieval Scandinavia: understand that there are a lot of liberties here. _A lot. Shamelessly so._ After all, I had to turn those stories and histories into something worthy of electric guitars and superfluous umlaut-inspired battles.

The land, people, gods, and monsters of Norden aren’t meant to be historic Scandinavia. For one, there are no such thing as Mythenders in reality. The nine worlds hanging on Yggdrasil (the World Tree), the Bifröst (Rainbow Bridge), Valhalla…all of those Norse ideas are treated as caricatures and colorful elements rather than something genuine.

Of course, you can make it as historic if you want. I invite you to do research, if any of these things interest you. But don’t take what’s in this chapter as a serious attempt at that. This Mythic Norden is a place where you slaughter gods and impose your will, not a place to explore a real culture. The real medieval Scandinavia is not one place, but a vast multitude of places. Many different cultures, languages, values, and beliefs. Many different gods and Myths, and different names for the same ones.

### How to use Mythic Norden

Think of Mythic Norden not a place with a sense of geography or realism, but as one formed around iconic concepts and forces of will. It’s a collection of sets: places where battles happen and people are met. It’s a collection of themes—Mythic worship and oppression, constant danger and fear, harsh and unforgiving weather, and so on.

While you may have thoughts about what the mortals desire and need, when the Mythenders enter a town, all life stands still for them. Some may pledge fealty so as to ask for a boon. Others will defend their gods, knowing they will be annihilated for challenging a Mythender. All will fear them. They know their lives are forever changed, and not for the better.

Even with all that, it’s good for the Mythmaster have ideas about what the mortals desired and needed before the Mythenders arrived. It will help you portray mortals as real people.

## The People of Norden

The people of this land are hostages to Myths, given graces and sanctuary when they worship the gods and fear real dangers in the uncharted wilderness. Within Norden are many small, mortal territories, some only as large as the town and farmlands outside, and some that span many cities. But because travel is dangerous, even on well-journeyed roads, the people are mostly isolated from one another.

They war with each other, at times because a patron god wishes his influence might be demonstrated, and at times because men wish the same thing.

They are real people—they love, hate, hope and fear. At least, until a Mythender comes along and strips their free will away.

### This Land

The mortals call the land in which they’re permitted to dwell Midgard. It means “land of the middle,” which reflects that the mortals know they are in the middle of all the forces of Norden, with no hope of escape.

## The Myths of Norden

The Myths of Norden are divided into many camps: the all-powerful and dominant Æsir, the glorious and beneficent Vanir, the vile jötnar, the ever-industrious dwarves, and the many Lesser Myths that roam throughout Midgard.

They all war with each other, as is Norden’s will—this makes the mortals fear and obey, giving the Mythic World so much power. And the Myths know that they never truly die at the hands of one another, for the World will take their essence and create new Myths.

### Gods of Order

The Æsir are Norden’s spirits of order and justice, though a vile and corrupted notion of justice: of knowing one’s place and never deviating it, for mortals to forever be subservient. Odin Allfather is the god over all the Æsir and, with his son Thor, rules over all of Norden. They war with the jötnar and other gods of chaos, and force all to bow to their will.

### Gods of Life

The Vanir are Norden’s spirits of life and growth. Freyja is the most prominent of the Vanir, as the goddess of motherhood and lust. Long ago, the Vanir were their own masters, but they have been dominated by Odin as his kind to serve Norden as they see fit.

### Gods of Chaos

Loki and his brood make of the spirits of chaos, of destruction and vicious change. The jötnar serve chaos unwittingly, as they fight and plot against the Æsir and all those who would submit to them, especially Norden’s mortals.

### A Vast Pantheon

There are many more gods of Norden than listed in the following pages. You can easily make an adventure center around another god instead, including:

- **Týr,** the Æsir God of Law and Justice
- **Heimdallr,** the Whitest God and possessor of vast foreknowledge
- **Mimir,** the beheaded God of Knowledge and Wisdom
- **Iðunn,** the Vanir Goddess of Everlasting Youth
- **Höðr,** the cursed and sorrowful God of Kinslaying
- **Hel,** the Goddess of Death and ruler of Norden’s underworld

See **Creating Your Own Myths**, for advice on turning one of these into a god for Mythenders to fight. And some basic Wikipedia research is enough to get you started.

### Ragnarök

Ragnarök is the fabled end times, when the gods will battle and kill one another. It is a time to fear and rejoice over, as it will herald the rebirth of Norden into a stronger Mythic World, for it can sacrifice all of its children at once for ultimate power.

However, the Mythenders have interfered, stealing away these sacrifices and taking Mythic power for their own. What the Mythenders promise is not Ragnarök (though many mortals are fooled into believing such), but a true End where Norden is no more.

## Some Cities & Towns

These are a few examples of places where mortals dwell in Norden. They are short, to be fleshed out as needed. Use them as-is, twist them to taste, or make your own.

### Fort of Thorberge

High atop one of the peaks in a vast mountain range lies a fortress dedicated to Thor. The mountain is bare, save for snow and rocky outcroppings. For generations, the fort has drilled for battle, waiting for the day when Thor spirits them away to be an army against his foes.

There is no farmland here, for nothing will grow. Within the temple, the high priests beseech their god to grant them food, clothing, firewood, and weapons so that they may continue to grow and train.

Storm clouds permeate the sky, with thunder that shows the people Thor’s blessing. On those rare days when the sky parts and the sun or stars are visible, the priests know those to be ill omens. Thor will answer no prayers on those days.

Those who die are committed to the Thunder Fields, a large slab of stone that Thor’s lightning always strikes. The bodies are turned to ash upon being hit, and the people watch as that ash funnels into the sky, taking those souls with it. Every three years, a dozen warriors are chosen by the high priests to join Thor’s army, and eagerly march to the Thunder Fields to join him.

#### Mortals of Note

**Sören, chief among the priests.** He is blessed with dominion over lightning, and has personally spoken with Thor over the years. He is the ruler of this fort.

**Greta, the Drillmaster Matron.** She is 80, but blessed with youth, so that she may continue to train Thor’s army and bear strong children. She is pregnant now, but that in no way hinders her skill or stops her from her duty.

**Alfreð, a warrior chosen for Thor’s company.** He is young, recently fathered twins, and is eager to show Thor his prowess with spear and axe.

**Unnar, a former warrior recently crippled.** He is shunned by others for he now cannot lift a sword and did not have the good sense to die with honor. He continues to ask the high priests to induct him so that he may learn healing arts and be of use to the community.

### Village of Norrsundet

Set near cliffs overlooking the raging sea, this village is home to a cult that pays tribute to the Jörmungandr, the world serpent. Once a season, the serpent comes to shed its blood upon this land. Those who are unworthy perish. Those who survive are given strength and health.

The fields in the surrounding lands grow fertile, its soil rich with the poisoned blood. The grain and roots are wild, dangerous, responding only to sorcerous farmers that speak with the land and force it to obey. The wildlife is just as vicious, and the villagers always carry arms so that they may slay beasts driven mad by the serpent’s blood. The meat of the boars in this land is prized for its flavor and the power it bestows.

Travelers come here to pay tribute to the Jörmungandr, in hopes to stave off Ragnarök a little longer. Some die, unable to partake in the poisoned food and drink; their bodies are added to the tribute. Some survive, and return to spread influence and corruption.

Even with the poisoned blood in their veins, the people of this place are not cruel or demonic. They are hardened because the land is unkind and because of their duty to Jörmungandr. But they have human hearts, and feel no different than others.

#### Mortals of Note

**Rúrik, a farmer-sorcerer who has recently come ill and unable to tend his crops.** This is a sign of Jörmungandr’s displeasure, and he will likely not live out the week.

**Einhildur, one of the brides of Jörmungandr.** She is with child, from the seed of a man mixed with the serpent’s blood. She is due any day now, and feels nothing but divine love within.

**Lára, a young hunter, whose birth was praised as sign of fortune and good omen.** Her arms are of serpent-scale rather than mortal flesh, and she can speak with animals.

**Marcus, a monk from the southern lands beyond Norden.** He came here to spread the world of Christ, but stays because he is in awe of Jörmungandr’s power.

### City of Syöteen

The capital of a small kingdom, Syöteen sits at the intersection of two rivers. Its King, Röterik, is a descendant of a great fire jötuun, a noteworthy sorcerer, and a kind leader. Through his guidance, the city has prospered and its denizens know peace and good fortune.

The Twin Rivers see traffic daily, merchants and newsbringers traveling to and from the city’s great golden walls. Inside are many small temples to various gods, no one god given great preference over another. The people believe that it is because they revere many gods that they are eternally triumphant.

The Sorrowed Forest borders to the east, where daring hunters seeking dangerous game can make a name for themselves and win marriage rights. The most feared beasts are the bears, twice the size of a man with six massive, powerful limbs.

Nearby is a small quarry, where conquered peoples are sent to work for one year sentences. Once their term is up, they may swear fealty to the King to be granted citizenship and the privilege of working elsewhere in the Kingdom.

#### Mortals of Note

**Röterik, King of Syöteen.** As he is very old and frail, he remains in his palace while he sits to judge crimes brought to him. The people praise his kindness and wisdom.

**Oddrún, a well-loved merchant.** She travels to Syöteen once a week to pedal wares she’s acquired from small towns in the north. Her son, Skíði, travels with her to learn the trade.

**Valdís, daughter of a minor baron.** She hopes that her beloved Galdur will return from the Sorrowed Forest with prize enough to win her hand, but he has been gone for many days.

**Ormur, a prisoner who will soon be freed from quarry service.** His clan was taken in a very uneven fight, peasants armed with simple weapons against a Syöteen brigade.

## Some Battle Sets

Along with the mortal dwellings in Mythic Norden, there are a number of great places where a battle can happen. Some places are earthly, and others take place in small realms where the Mythic World is strange and beautiful.

As always, use as-is, flesh out, twist them, or take as inspiration for your own.

Each one comes with three vague ideas for a Blight the Myth or Mythenders could create. Naturally, that relies more on their abilities rather than the land around them. But if you’re looking for ideas that mesh with the environment, here you go. (Just remember that Myths and Mythenders can also violate the hell of out of wherever they battle, so don’t be beholden.)

### Earthly Sets

#### In the Sea

A raging storm makes the sea around you convulse with rage. Waves crash with intent, to drag all into its depths. The sky is starless, the clouds letting only moonlight shine through. The cold, salty spray sticks on your face.

_Blight Ideas_: thunderous whirlpool, drowned sailors awoken, living lightning in the water.

#### Snow-Covered Plains

Fresh snow has fallen. Far in the distance: trees, mountains, faint signs of people. But those are miles away. The only things breaking the monotony around you are occasional hills. This place is just asking to be covered red and black with blood and bile.

_Blight Ideas_: summoning tornados and flash storms, rock becoming living quicksand, snow turning into sea.

#### Forest of Woe

Tall, green trees shield the ground from the snow. The earth is fresh, its musty aroma sweeping through the breeze. Small animals run in fear around you, fleeing for far-off sanctuary. Only the ravens remain, watching from high above.

_Blight Ideas_: trees and roots alive with malice, forest spirits summoned, spontaneous fire.

#### Hot Springs

The ground around you steams, one of the rare places in Norden where Myths of heat dominate over those of frost. Mounds erupt and boiling water spews forth. All around you are the remains of long-dead animals and unwary travelers.

_Blight Ideas_: water turning to lava as it emerges, creatures forged from rock, raging earth given voice and malicious purpose.

#### Flooded Plains

Two great rivers cross here, and the gods have chosen them to flood. The mud is knee-deep at the shallowest, and the current is unkind to the weak. Remains of animals, homes, and men float about in this watery graveyard.

_Blight Ideas_: water freezing and the dead becoming ice creatures, sudden whirlpool, dangerous water creatures summoned.

#### A Nigh-Bottomless Chasm

The earth is split in twain by a giant’s axe, the gash spanning miles across and even farther down. The wind whistles and moans through the chasm, threatening to off-balance those at the edge. One rope bridge stretches the divide, inviting only those bold to cross.

_Blight Ideas_: ancient fires spew forth, wind given form of hands and arms, chasm grows teeth and becomes a maw.

### Mythic Sets

When setting in a Mythic set, you might want to make that set also a Companion weapon—such places are as alive as any Myth. (Shoot, you might even want to make that set the Myth itself. Ending Yggdrasil can be fun!)

#### Among the Clouds

Gray thunderclouds are solid enough for your footsteps, like walking in a marsh. They move about, crashing into each other and spreading apart, making hills and pitfalls as they roll. Lightning travels through them, the only light here flashing about with inconsistent will.

_Blight Ideas_: lightning—lots of lightning, clouds given will to grab and drag down, deafening
thunder spirits.

#### Valhalla, Great Hall of the Slain

Golden opulence fills this vast hall. Thousands upon thousands of warriors stand at attention, staring at you. The god’s throne sits high on the opposite end, made from the thick branches of the golden tree Glasir. Heavy footsteps are heard from the ceiling of shields far above.

_Blight Ideas_: Rain of shields, those slain in battle refusing to stay dead, all that is golden forming into vile constructs.

_Companion Ideas_: The numerous slain, Valhalla’s native Myths.

#### On the Bifröst

Only the stars above and the light shimmering off of the rainbow bridge contrast the utter darkness of night and space. Each ribbon of color is wide enough for a horse to stand. There is only the cool warmth of light, and endless darkness below.

_Blight Ideas_: stars falling from the sky, burning and vicious light, howling and grabbing abyss.

#### The Base of Yggdrasil

The roots that compose the ground extend for miles, hovering in nothingness. Far below you, the dragon Níðhöggr holds in the abyss and gnaws at the roots. Fierce winds carry the scent of old earth. Many portals to other worlds hang far above, like fruit waiting to be picked.

_Blight Ideas_: angry roots waking, the pull of nothingness grabbing at warriors, fiends summoned from the nine worlds.

_Companion Idea_: Níðhöggr, the eternal dragon.

## Monsters & Lesser Myths

The monsters that roam Norden’s lands are known as lesser Myths. Some are twisted and evil creatures of the forest, others are spirits that feed on mortalkind’s terror, and even mortals sorcerers corrupted by power fill their ranks. Along with them are Myths of legend, such as the jötnar (frost and fire giants), einherjar (long-dead warriors), and servants to the gods like the valkyries.

### Lesser Myths & Fighting Mythenders

Lesser Myths know that they will likely be Ended, for Mythenders are far more powerful than they. Still, they do not all take the same reaction or notion to that.

Some believe they will be remade by their masters, so their death is temporary. This is natural; Myths die all the time in Norden, and death is only as permanent as the gods wish. Such is why few understand the difference between death and being Ended—but there is no explaining their complete destruction to them.

Others know that their lives are forfeit upon sight of a Mythender, but they do their duty for their god. They know that this battle aids their god and Norden, and seek to drive a Mythender closer to Falling. Some do this because they see no reason to question. Others do this because to refuse is to have no honor—and one should never underestimate the lengths anyone, mortal or Myth, will do for honor.

And even more are purely mindless, such as the undead draugr (**Draugr, the Vile Dead**) or Mythic dire wolves. There is no talking or reason—there is only hunting and death.

### Using Lesser Myths

#### Stats

Lesser Myths have a Storm rating between 3 and 5, start with 2 to 4 Thunder die, and have a wound cost of 4. Their Wound tracks are the same as a Mythender’s: 3-4-5. They start with 6 to 8 Might tokens and recharge 2 to 4 Might each turn.

The jötnar (**Jötnar, the Giants**) are considered lesser Myths, but they’re more powerful than most others. As such, they have higher ratings—good for experienced players or for adventures with more than one battle before reaching the god.

#### Weapons

Lesser Myths always have three Weapons. Choose from those listed. With rare exception, they us the standard charge boxes. For Intrinsic Weapons, the middle box (<span class="keyword">+2 dice</span>) starts charged.

#### Companion Weapons

Many Lesser Myths come in hordes. They’re usually their own Companion Weapon.

Some are servants of Greater Myths (page 218), which makes them great Companion Weapons for one (or even for a more powerful Lesser Myth). Some Myths already have ideas listed, but if one of these screams to be a servant for another, go for it!

#### Gifts

Lesser Myths have three or four Gifts, including upgrades.

### Gathering Rage

Lesser Myths have <span class="keyword">Gathering Rage</span> (**The Myth’s Tricks**) triggers that set up future battles. The following are the standard ones, but feel free to switch them up. You might even shorten the number of rounds, though the last round remains the same: the battle being over.

- **After Round One…**
  Lesser Myths have no Gathering Rage triggers from the first round of battle.

- **After Round Two…**
  Create a new lasting Blight at the end of the battle.

- **After Round Three…**
  Give the upcoming god an additional Weapon charge.

- **After Round Four…**
  Give the upcoming god three more Thunder dice.

- **After Round Five…**
  <span class="keyword">The battle is over</span>. Either the Lesser Myth (or what’s left of it) escapes, dies on its own terms, or is spirited away by a Greater Myth or the Mythic World itself. Regardless, the ritual of battle has given the Myth more power. In the adventure’s climatic battle, the god will have an additional Weapon box charged.

## Einherjar, the Honored Dead

Warriors that die on the field of battle, or are taken by the gods as living sacrifices, are brought to Valhalla. There they feast gluttonously on Mythic beast and mead, giving them immense strength and stamina. Each day they spar, honing their talents for the day that they are called upon to face a Mythender.

In battle, they rage. This is their sole purpose, and they are eager to fulfill it. Each warrior has faced and felt death so many times that they no longer fear destruction. Their food and drink dulls all sense of pain and heightens bloodlust. But they are not mindless; among them are captains and generals who still know the arts of war.

(By the way, the singular of “einherjar” is “einherji.”)

## Valkyries, Warriors Beyond Death

Beautiful war maidens fathered from the spirit of battle, valkyries serve the gods of Norden as warrior-psychopomps. They bring the slain to the gods Odin and Freyja, breathe life back into them, and forge them into living weapons. They are drillmasters of the einherjar, pushing them to become legends and rewarding them with carnal delights.

There are few mortals of Norden who could match valkyries in battle. They serve as flying cavalry, hurling endless spears from a distance, trampling those who close on them. They are each worthy commanders, masters of tactics and strategy.

It goes without saying that those slain by valkyries are afterward stolen by them, given life again in Valhalla and put to Mythic purpose.

## Draugr, the Vile Dead

Draugr are the corrupted dead that were once mortal rulers, twisted in the grave by spirits of wrathful avarice. They rose, keeping to their rotting bodies, and roam the lands to steal from the living. They are not content to steal just material things: loved ones, souls, and flesh are all fair game to the draugr.

Unlike other undead beings of legend, they are not mindless—they possess the memories of their former existence and the cunning of generals and kings. Death and decay follow them, and they know how to tap into that as superior strength and black magic.

Most of all, they seek to steal more Mythic power, and that draws them to Mythenders. These vile undead hate and steal from each other, but they will band together if Mythenders are near, for the chance to taste flesh and blood with vast Mythic power is too rich to ignore.

## Sorcerers, Corrupted Mortals

Mythenders are not the only mortals to be given Mythic power. The gods and spirits of Mythic Norden seeks out mortals who have a lust for power and whose hearts will not resist temptation. These mortals are given tests of mind and will from tomes of hidden knowledge, and if they pass, they are granted untold power.

Sorcerers are often would-be warlords and kings, using their Mythic might to force mortals to obey them. The only difference between them and Norden’s Myths made from fallen Mythenders is that they chose to embrace Corruption from the outset.

As emissaries of great power, each of their Weapons counts as Intrinsic, even if it’s also a Relic or Companion (thus making them Greater Weapons). This is the boon Norden gives its sorcerers.

## Jötnar, the Giants

Giants forged from pure hatred and weather itself, the jötnar (singular: jötunn) are hideous masses. Half again as large as a man, each one is deformed in some way—claws and fangs, numerous limbs or heads, some not even resembling men at all. What is common is far greater strength than even their size would suggest and power over the weather spirits that birthed them.

Even though they are creations of Norden, the Mythic World goes to great lengths to keep them away from mortal lands, for they cannot be controlled. Some ally with Loki and his brood, others make their own kingdoms and march to war to prove that the Mythic World needs no mortals to survive.

The jötunn kingdoms are harsh and treacherous, even to their own kind. Only the strongest and most willful survive the journey into other lands. And each one believes itself capable of becoming a greater Myth, as Fenrir and Jörmungandr have, by having their blood spilled by a Mythender and spilling that Mythender’s blood in return.

The two most common giants are of frost and of fire:

#### Frost Jötnar

Frost giants, who call themselves the _hrimþursar_, live in a valley of ice far beyond the mountains known to mortals. Their gray skin freezes any mortal flesh that it touches.

Eternal night covers the kingdom of frost. The only lights that shine are the stars and the moon, forever full. The frost jötnar claim to remember a time before the sun and the coming of mortals, when they ruled over all. They call this _Fimbulvetr_, the Age of Peace, and say their time will come again.

#### Fire Jötnar

Fire giants, also known as _múspellsmegir_, live in a land far below the surface, in the steaming bowels of the earth. Their skin looks like molten rock, and fire flares from them.

It is foretold that they will herald Ragnarök, the end of all the worlds. When they aren’t training and plotting to burn the rest of Norden and usher in an age of fire, they send small bands up to the surface to raid for slaves, both mortal and Mythic.

### Notes

Jötnar are more powerful than other lesser Myths, good for a longer game with multiple lesser Myth battles. Note that they have an Intrinsic/Companion Greater Weapon. Frost jötnar are more resilient, with their second Wound box also at 3. Fire jötnar have a stronger Weapon charge progression, starting with <span class="keyword">+4 dice</span>.

### Gifts

Jötnar have six gifts. Four standard ones are listed below. The other two may be filled in either before or during the battle, as per Greater Myths (**Gods & Greater Myths**).

## Gods & Greater Myths

The gods and their unique foes of legend make up the greater Myths. These foes should be the climax of an adventure. Each god embodies a concept in the Mythic World: Odin of order, Thor of war, Loki of chaos, Freyja of love, and so on.

### Greater Myths & Fighting Mythenders

While each god has a specific personality and view of Mythenders, they have two general takes on fighting them. Both are equally megalomanic: they either are certain of their victory, or know that while they may be destroyed, they’ll be reborn when a Mythender becomes a Myth from this battle.

Given that nearly every greater Myth was once a Mythender who defeated a god but failed to fight off Norden’s embrace, there’s truth in this. There have been many Odins, Thors, Lokis, Jörmungandrs, and so on.

Those that speak to Mythenders will mock the futility of Ending them, sometimes as a villainous prologue to the battle. Those that don’t will just get their vicious attack on.

### Using Greater Myths

#### Stats

Greater Myths greatly vary in their Storm rating, starting Thunder dice, Wound cost and track, starting Might and Might recharging. The main similarity is that they all have five Wound boxes.

#### Weapon Charge Boxes

Greater Myths have four Weapons, and will typically sunder one in battle for power (**The Myth’s Tricks**). Choose from those listed.

The gods listed here have different charge boxes: <span class="keyword">+4 dice</span>, <span class="keyword">+2 dice</span>, <span class="keyword">+2 dice</span>. Note that the second and third are the same, and there’s no Might bonus. Other gods may have different ones. Regardless, there are always only three charge boxes, and the middle one starts charged with Intrinsic Weapons.

If Lesser Myths have escaped, you may charge more Weapon boxes as per their escape.

Greater Myths often have Greater Weapons, mixing two Weapon types—for instance, combining a Relic and Companion—and giving those Weapons access to both rules. No Weapon uses all three. That’s just crazy talk. (See **Gaining Greater Weapons** for more on Greater Weapons.)</a>

#### Companion Weapons

Most write-ups suggest Companions, but also consider using the lesser Myths you’ve thrown at the Mythenders, or taking inspiration from the set for this climatic battle.

#### Gifts

Greater Myths have seven to ten Gifts, including upgrades. They may have two or three slots open; you may fill in one per round.

#### Screwing With This

Greater Myths change over time, especially when one’s been Ended and a Mythender takes its place. Feel free to twist the stats on a god and how that god views Mythenders.

### Gathering Rage

Greater Myths have <span class="keyword">Gathering Rage</span> (**The Myth’s Tricks**) triggers that directly affect this battle, as it is constantly gathering power from Norden. The following are the standard ones, but feel free to switch them up. Beware of shortening the rounds, as that makes the battle much, much more dangerous.

Some Greater Myths detail changes to this.

- **After Round One…**
  Allow sundering of a Weapon.
- **After Round Two…**
  Create or charge a Blight.
- **After Round Three…**
  Gain 5 Thunder dice.
- **After Round Four…**
  Gain 10 Lightning tokens.
- **After Round Five…**
  <span class="keyword">The Mythenders die</span>. The battle is over. The god has had time to gather enough power from Norden to end the would-be Enders of Myth. The Mythenders are all slain and denied the Choice to return. The game is over.

### Greater Myths & Difficulty

Each of these Greater Myths listed vary in difficulty.

<span class="keyword">Thor</span> is the most “basic” of the gods. He’s designed to be the first god a Mythender Ends, a good choice for people new to playing <span class="mythender">Mythender</span>. If you wish to have such players face off against a different god, consider using Thor’s stats and Gifts, and just rename the god and change the Weapons accordingly.

<span class="keyword">Odin</span> is very tough and straightforward, compared to some of the other gods. He’s built to brawl and survive, constantly gathering Thunder dice. Mythenders will be hardpressed to beat Odin without dipping deep in Mythic Power and doing Titanic actions.

<span class="keyword">Freyja</span> is a difficult and tricky god, as she constantly pushes the Mythender’s Corruption by simply existing near them. This is a god suitable for players who have prior experience battling gods in <span class="mythender">Mythender</span>, because they’ll need to End her quickly if they want to avoid apotheosis.

<span class="keyword">Loki</span> is similar to Odin in power, and more resilient—he has a harder Wound track. That means Mythenders will need to gather more and more Lightning in order to beat him quickly.

<span class="keyword">Jörmungandr</span> is possibly the hardest of Greater Myths. It constantly Wounds the Mythenders in a tide of its poisonous blood and it has a shorter duration before it outright slaughters them.

<span class="keyword">Fenrir</span> is on par with Jörmungandr. It can use the <span class="keyword">Grievous Harm</span> Gift for free, making it a formidable opponent.

## Thor, God of Thunder & War

Thor, the god of thunder and war, is the self-proclaimed protector of all mortalkind. His command over Norden’s constant storms gives him dominion over the entire land, and the fear and awe those storms inspire in mortals in turn gives him limitless might.

His legendary hammer Mjölnir holds one piece of Norden’s true heart. Megingjörð, the Belt of Strength, gives him the power to lift and hurl even mountains. And his massive and vile goats, Tanngrisnir and Tanngnóstr, carry Thor’s massive chariot and fight along with him, using their sharpened hooves to trample and razor teeth to shred.

Thor is the master and commander over much of Norden’s martial forces: the valkyries and the einherjar, due not only to being Odin Allfather’s son, but to his skills as a tactician and in single combat. Because of this, the mortal warriors revere Thor and seek to join him in death. He has forged dozens of warrior cults among mortalkind, taking the best as his own personal Thunder Guard—fusing the essence of lightning into their souls, creating beings that rival the jötnar. Few taste this honor, and fewer still are worthy enough to survive the rite. Still, Thor has many more beings in his service, notably valkyries and einherjar.

To Thor, Mythenders are the rare worthy challenge he deserves. He embraces battle with this happily—either he will best them and prove his might, or he will fall, but in doing so drive a Mythender to become him, making the next Thor more powerful than the last.

## Odin Allfather

Also known as Odin the All-Wise and Odin One-Eye, he is the king of Æsir—the gods that reflect the half of Norden that embodies order. As he is most revered among all the gods in Norden, Odin is the wisest and commands the most powerful magics.

Odin travels around the land on his eight-legged warhorse, Sleipnir. His spear Gungnir is imbued with the spirit of flight and truth, and will never miss its target. Chief among his many Mythic animal companions are his ravens Huginn and Muninn (the very essence of thought and memory in all Norden) and his wolves Geri and Freki (the twin spirits of hunger and need).

He has fathered many sons, most of whom are lesser Myths and half-mortal abominations. A rare few rise to the stature of god, most notably Thor. Odin also commands one half of all einherjar, many valkyries, and all other beings of Myth allied to Norden’s spirits of order.

To Odin, Mythenders are part of the natural order—that of cleansing destruction. But that Mythenders would go after any of the Æsir is unnatural, a clear sign that the forces of chaos have perverted Norden’s need to purge. This perversion must be corrected, and will be when the Mythenders fall into Norden’s embrace.

## Freyja, Goddess of Motherhood & Lust

Freyja is the goddess of love, beauty, fertility, life, war, and death. She is the womb of Norden, the spirit of life-that-is and life-that-must-be. She is queen of the Vanir, those gods of Norden who rule over the spirits of growth and prosperity.

She is never without her host of utterly devoted thralls. Freyja lays claim to half of the einherjar, has her own valkyries, and every mortal and creature that lays eyes on her beauty falls in love and unquestioning devotion. They walk alongside her cat-drawn chariot or her war-boar Hildisvíni. Her necklace Brísingamen has the power to make hearts feel greed for it and mistrust of their fellows.

Freyja takes many forms, and will appear as the Mythenders’ mothers, lovers, and unrequited desires. She assaults their will with soothing words and tempting urges, eroding will not from the outside with blades, but the inside with needs and hope.

To Freyja, Mythenders are violent wayward children to be corrected with motherly love and new would-be lovers to train. She does not seek to destroy them, and indeed she does not fight. Her Mythic love radiates inside of them with her mere presence. But she is not powerless; her thralls accompany her to be shields and spears.

## Loki, God of the Wild

Loki is nothing less than Norden’s spirit of all that is wild, and as such is not bound to form or nature. He is the master, and perhaps mother, of all magic in the land. Through his loins he forges many of Norden’s untamable beasts: notably Jörmungandr and Fenrir.

He detests direct, formal conflict, for that is not the way of nature. Chaos is all around us, randomly killing or freeing, ambushing or giving boon. Such is Loki and his magic. Though he has jötunn blood, he appears however he wishes—sometimes as an old man, sometimes as an animal, but often as someone kin to Odin and his sons. Thus he is the embodiment of guile and deceit.

Loki has few possessions of his own, as he is far more delighted to steal something precious from another god before Mythenders approach. To see Loki with Thor’s Mjölnir or Odin’s Gungnir would not be surprising. However, he is more than capable with his own magics alone; the Relics of others are never because he needs them, simply for a devilish laugh.

To Loki, Mythenders are a delight and strange kin. For as long as they hold their mortal and Mythic nature in balance, they are truly wild—beings that are not yet tamed by either side. But that they will one day be tamed, by power or death, they are not true kin. Still, he sighs in a way that an artist would at being presented a majestic painting he must then destroy.

## Jörmungandr, the World Serpent

The serpent that loops around the world, Jörmungandr is the deadliest of the greater Myths. Its Mythic blood is poison even to all else in Norden, for everything that the Mythic World found too dangerous to touch and too powerful to destroy found its way onto this immense serpent.

Jörmungandr is Norden’s spirit of purity, although one that very few even among the gods understand. It stands alone in battle, having no one fight alongside it save for the sea that contains its blood. It speaks no language out of choice, as all words are impure. If one cannot decipher its intent and desire through its actions, then they are of no consequence.

Born from the witch-jötunn Angrboða and fathered by Loki, the world serpent is one of the rare jötunn-spawn that Norden has blessed with apotheosis. It keeps no legendary trinkets as the Æsir gods do; the Weapons it possesses all come from within.

To Jörmungandr, Mythenders are like everything else in the world: impure. Its blood will wash away all that is unrighteous—and if anything remains, it will join the might that is the World Serpent.

## Fenrir, the Unstoppable Wolf

Fenrir was one of the earliest Mythenders, before transforming into Norden’s spirit of destruction. He then became a creature born of Loki and the witch-jötunn Angrboða, sibling to Jörmungandr. He is a massive wolf, easily as large as a castle, with ancient gray hairs peppering his otherwise brown coat.

Fenrir Ended the god Týr, the god of heroism and glory, savagely dominating him even as he transformed into the wolf he is now. At the very end, he bit down on Týr’s sword-hand and swallowed it whole—gauntlet and sword included—taking in that Mythic essence and bonding with it. He sometimes confronts challengers with Týr’s sword wielded in his mouth.

No one in Norden hates as Fenrir does—Norden created him to house its spirit of hatred. He kept his mortal anger at gods and Norden, holds contempt for mortals who lack the power and will to be their own beings, at nature and the world for being an imperfect vessel, and at himself for failing to be invulnerable to Mythic Corruption.

To Fenrir, Mythenders are Norden’s great cosmic joke. He has all of the memories of each Mythender who has come before him, all of them corrupted and turned into Fenrir just as the first one was. But he does not laugh at them for their part in this farce; he saves his rage for the rest of creation, and just wishes battle with Mythenders to be over quickly, so he may go back to his revenge.

## Creating Your Own Myths

There are many other ideas for foes in from Old Norse folklore: the elves, both light and dark; dwarves; witches; various creatures and spirits of the forest; etc. You could even branch out, making a sorcerer-king a foe, along with his army of clay warriors. If you can think of a good fight, you have a foe worthy of Ending.

You can do some basic research on Wikipedia or great and well-researched roleplaying games and supplements (the various _GURPS_ source books are fantastic for this). Or you can take inspiration from media and make “the dragon like from the _Beowulf_ film.” Whatever works for you and your game.

The first step to making a new Myth is to just reskin one of the existing ones. Take for instance the einherjar for a Lesser Myth or Thor for a Greater Myth. Then change the name and description, and come up with Weapons appropriate to that new Myth. (Always have at least two different types of Weapons. No Myth should have all of one type.)

### Iconic Myths

If you’re making a Greater Myth, make it an iconic being. It’s one thing to kill a dragon or a few dragons, but going after The Dragon—the very concept of what a dragon is—is pretty metal. Or take an idea, like the God of Hatred, and build a Myth around that.

### Making Myths More Powerful

You might want to turn one of the Myths in this chapter up to eleven. Do so by changing their Weapon bonuses or adding more Gifts, including empty Gift slots it has to fill in during the battle.

Maybe your Thor is more extreme. Make all of his Weapons also Intrinsic, giving them the extra charge box. But also describe how he’s different, like maybe it’s physically made of pure lightning itself in the shape of a man rather than a god that merely commands and spiritually embodies lightning.

Once you’ve played <span class="mythender">Mythender</span> some, tweak the numbers. Raising starting Thunder gives it a jump ahead on Wounding the Mythenders and possibly extends their life. Raising Storm will mean that every turn it’s alive, it’ll build up more Thunder; that makes for a more dangerous Myth than raising starting Thunder.

Raising the starting Might gives a Myth more options early in the battle, and raising the Might recharge gives it more options on later turns. Naturally, that depends on the Gifts a Myth has, and the more varied the Gifts, the more ways the Myth can fuck up the Mythenders’ day.

### Myths from Other Places

Mythic Norden is a powerful Mythic World, one that has lasted for some time. Other Myths may have taken refuge in Norden after their Worlds were Ended. It would be weird to have some djinn or Quezecoatal in Norden, but that sort of weirdness is totally in keeping with the surreality of Mythic Worlds. Also, it’s plain fucking cool.

## Thorberge: a Norden Adventure

The Mythenders are traveling to the Fort of Thorberge (**Some Cities & Towns**) to end Thor. This adventure uses a short structure and is great for people new to playing <span class="mythender">Mythender</span>.

### Introduction

Take the snow-covered plains set (**Some Battle Sets**) and tweak it to be about a mountainside, high up where the peak—and the fort—are just barely visible. The storm clouds above crackle. The Mythenders know that they are here to hunt Thor, and that the fort nearby is strongly connected to him.

### Mythmaster’s Time: Battle with Einherjar (Tutorial)

A host of einherjar (**Einherjar, the Honored Dead**), numbering in the hundreds, emerges from the clouds, the ground, mists—describe their introduction and what the battlefield looks like.

They will first shout at the Mythenders, telling them to go elsewhere, that there are ignoble gods to be slain. Jörmungandr is in the sea to the west, and surely he is worthy of their attention. (Of course, this shouldn’t sway the characters one bit. It’s simple posturing.)

Either the Mythenders will declare that they’re engaging or you will for the einherjar. Remember that, regardless of color, the Myth always gets the first action. Use the **Tutorial Battle** chapter unless everyone is familiar with playing the game.

At the end of the battle, turn the most destructive Blight or one perilous to mortals into a lasting Blight, per the einherjar’s Gathering Rage.

### Mythender’s Time: Mortal Interlude

The Mythenders arrive at **Thorberge**. Many mortals are already outside, on their knees, bowing and sobbing. The priests are inside, refusing to bow to anyone other than Thor, and cowering in their temple.

The Blight should be making life hell for the mortals. These people love and praise Thor, and will plea with the Mythenders to turn away.

Once you’ve painted this picture, ask each Mythender: “what do you do?” You may need to remind them about seeking sympathy, terrorizing mortals for power, and doing epic, badass feats. (See the **Moments Quick Reference**.)

### Mythmaster’s Time: Climatic Battle with Thor

Once everyone gets a chance to do one thing, **Thor** arrives. The Mythenders are taken into the clouds for this battle (use the in the clouds set from **Some Battle Sets**). Choose four Weapons for Thor, and use them to describe the impending battle.

Thor may taunt the Mythenders, explaining their futility because he will only be reborn from one of their souls when this is over. This should be brief, and then if the characters haven’t already, Thor will launch into battle. Again, regardless of color, the Myth always gets the first action.

### Epilogue

With Thor ended, the Mythenders watch as the people react. If any terrorized for power, then the mortals now worship them. If not, they are thankful for their newfound freedom.

# Being a Mythmaster

## Running Mythender

<span class="mythender">Mythender</span> is a game of vast battles with fluid, flexible space in between. When you play the game, you’ll be shifting gears between your time (where the battle rules strongly structure the flow of the game) and the Mythenders’ time (where they’re no strict structure, but rules to cover situations that come up in between battle).

If you’ve run other adventure games with the same format, like _Dungeons & Dragons_, some of that experience will be useful for running <span class="mythender">Mythender</span>.

If this is the first time you’ve done something like this, don’t worry! This chapter will give you some guidelines. Your first few games of this (or anything similar) might be a little rocky, but with practice you’ll get a good sense of pacing—the key skill in making an adventure game like <span class="mythender">Mythender</span> sing.

### Overview

**On Making Mistakes as a Mythmaster**

Starting off, you have permission to screw up, as long as you are willing to acknowledge your slip-ups and fix them.

**Interact with the Players**

Interacting with the players is the heart and soul of <span class="mythender">Mythender</span>. Take these rules and hold well to them.

**Describe the World**

Describing the vast Mythic World helps everyone, including you, buy into the idea that you’re in a fantastical place with gods that need killin’.

**Interact with the World**

Here are some bits on interaction with the Mythenders, as befits an epic game, through the lenses of both mortals and Myths.

**Tone & Scale**

For this game to work, you need to moderate tone and scale. Here are some ways to achieve that and how to talk about it at the table.

**Pacing**

Pacing an adventure game is easy when you’re battling and harder when you’re outside of that battle space.

**Drifting & Hacking Mythender**

Some folks like hacking a game for some other settings. Here are a few notes for that.

**Mythmaster Key Techniques**

When in doubt, here are the basic things to remember while running <span class="mythender">Mythender</span> summarized. This is useful to print out and have at the table. Also included are a few key phrases to keep in mind while being a Mythmaster.

### These are Rules

The contents of this chapter are just as much rules as everything in the battle chapter. It’s just that these rules are soft—they don’t tell you when to use them, because that requires your judgment as the Mythmaster.

A session of <span class="mythender">Mythender</span> is a temperamental creature. If you don’t use the tools you have available, it can turn on your and bite your head off…or slink into a corner and die from boredom. That’s what this chapter is all about: rules and tools. They will help you create a soaring epic of badassery. Disregarding them means you have to work that much harder to achieve the same ends.

### Authority & Rules Mastery

You’re the authority on the rules and making calls as to when a given rule applies. You’re also the authority on whether or not a character is being Mythic—doing something that would gain Mythic power—or not being Mythic and intentionally avoiding Corruption. There’s more on this in **Tone and Scale** (page 244), but know that this is part of your job.

### Tips for First-Time Mythmasters

#### Take it Slow

Don’t be shy about taking it slow and flipping to a certain part of the book to look up how something works. Each two-page spread is meant to be easy to find and easy to use during play.

#### Tutorial, Tutorial, Tutorial

Play out the Tutorial battle. It will help you feel how the game works, and everyone learns better by doing than by just reading.

#### Watch High-Octane Media

Seed your mind with media of people being crazy badass, like _300_, _The Avengers_, various awesome anime and related stuff like _Final Fantasy VII: Advent Children_. Even watching some _Dragonball Z_ could help you see how to do a Mythending battle. If it’s an epic battle movie, television show, or comic, it’s worth checking out before you play <span class="mythender">Mythender</span> so you have a more immediate sense of tone and scale.

#### Grovel & Enjoy It

You’ll see more of this on page 240, but make sure you do bow and grovel at times. Players used to other games won’t expect this from you, and it’s often their first clue that they really are playing epic characters.

_Do not skimp on this!_

#### There is no “Maybe”

Mythenders don’t “maybe” do something, except in cases of resisting Corruption. So when you’re playing with people who are unsure about what their characters can do, guide them and help them learn that there are no hard limits as there are costs for the scale of action.

## On Making Mistakes as a Mythmaster

Let’s start off by saying this:

### It’s Okay to Make Mistakes

Don’t sweat trying too hard.

This book has already thrown a lot of rules at you, and the rest of this chapter is going to talk about how to set tone, pacing, interaction, all sorts of stuff. Some people will read this and think “yeah, I already run games like that.” Some people will read this and pick up everything at once. Some will think they’ve got this, and find they don’t when they try running it. And some will find this whole thing to be intimidating, with all the dice and rules and whatnot.

I’m here to say that it’ll be okay. Because, honestly, you cannot fuck up my game more than I have! (See the next page.) And because if you’re fortunate with the people you’re playing with, they actually want to have fun and will help you succeed at running <span class="mythender">Mythender</span>.

### Fixing Mistakes

When something happens where you either get some rule wrong or screw up tone or whatever, pause the game. Acknowledge the mistake. Roll the game back if it’s not a huge hassle for everyone, or just push forward and be mindful of what happened for the future.

Ask for opinions. Enlist everyone in helping you remember whatever rule got missed or to call you on running an unfun game. You’re all in this together.

The most important thing, though, is to _be honest about whatever happened_.

### One of My Biggest Mythmaster Mistakes

Early in <span class="mythender">Mythender</span>’s development, I ran a game for some friends after work. We were just going to do a short game, testing some mechanics, but as I like to try to make playtests feel like an actual game (as otherwise it’s like testing a board game, which tests for far different issues), we did narration and all that jazz.

I had the village they arrived at hate on them, shout at them to go away, spit at them, that sort of treatment. I figured I would create some tension between “do you decide to be evil and kill them, or good and not kill them?”

My good friend Jerry then asked me: “We can kill them without rolling anything, right? You said that earlier today.” That was, in fact, one of the new rules I introduced in this playtest. (The benefits for that, all the terrorizing stuff, came two years later, so it wasn’t even something you were rewarded for at this stage.)

I grinned and affirmed that. Then he threw me a curve ball: “Um, do _they_ know that?”

I looked around and saw that the players were annoyed, and not in a fun “Bioware moral choice” way. Even though it was an experiment, it was also a game, and I just made a huge mistake. I misjudged how they’d react.

#### How I Fixed It

“You know, they should totally know that. Can we replay the scene?” The players agreed, and instead of having them spit at the Mythenders, they all treated them as people to be feared, begging them to go to another village and to spare them.

(Incidentally, that was when all the rules about how mortals view Mythenders were born.)

## Interact with the Players

First and foremost, _treat the players like they are Mythenders_.

This makes the difference between playing a game where you are just told you’re epic heroes and where you _feel_ like epic heroes. The main way to do this is to treat them like they have a higher status than you.

### Be Their Narrative Butler

Present choices to them, whether in character creation or during play, with deference and politeness. Pretend that they could just kill you with a glance, and you should be utterly respectful. (It’s good practice; that’s how you should portray mortals in Mythender.) “Would you like to see the other History options, Lady Mythender?” or “Which Weapon are you using now, Lord Mythender?”

Watch for that smile, as they’re being treated with respect they aren’t normally given in games _as players_. Revel in that glee. When you have that, you know you have that player hooked.

Whatever you do, keep “Of course, Lord Mythender” in your back pocket. It can sometimes redeem a dull moment, and remind the players without overtly stating it that they should get with the awesome.

### Grovel & Beg Forgiveness at Times

This is based on the above point, to reinforce the feel of the game. When you present a choice and they decline it, say “I apologize for presuming, Lady Mythender.”

The point isn’t to be subservient, but to remind them of the sort of character they’re playing. And to create a pattern of behavior so that you can mess with it by doing the next bit.

### Challenge Them at Times

The flip side of treating players as Mythenders is to treat them with expectation. If they’re playing it safe during battles, push back. “You’re not taking the Mythic Die? Oh, so would you like me to also change your diaper?” Goad them into taking Corruption.

Don’t do this much outside of battle. They should make the choice to act horrific or heal themselves. The only thing that you should push against is inaction. “So, Lord Mythender, with all your power you’re just going to let the Endless Fire burn up the farmlands? That’s cool. How do you feel when your Companions look at you with tears in their eyes because the screams of the people in the fire echoing throughout the land breaks their hearts? Or did you, you know, want to actually do something?”

The other thing to challenge is anytime someone is telling you what they’re doing mechanically but not what their character is doing in the story. Lines like “I’m sorry, this isn’t ‘Boring Mortals for Power’” or “What was that? I couldn’t hear it over how totally badass the Mythender before you was” can help reinforce this.

### Celebrate Them

When they accomplish a feat or act in battle, celebrate that. Every moment a Mythender acts is amazing and incredible in the mortals in the world, so make the players feel that. Responding to an excited description of a moment in battle with “Yeah you do!” or “That’s awesome!” will push that feeling of actually playing an amazing, epic character.

This is also known to some as the “Hell yeah you do!” rule.

### Toss Questions to Them

Sometimes you’ll get some great ideas from the players, so throw out questions and take in their input. You can ask them for facts, like “What time of day is it? What does the sky look like?” You can ask them to describe a fact you’ve brought up, like saying “You hear the sea nearby, and it sounds strange and haunted. What do you hear whispered into your ears by the voice of the sea?”

Some players love doing this, and some hate it. Know your players, as always. But if you can pull this off, you’ll get great buy-in from them, and you’ll get fantastic material to work with. Five heads have more creative juice than just one.

This will also get players who are shy a little used to bringing up ideas, which is important when in battle they get to Push Forward.

#### “I don’t know, can you?”

New players will often phrase things as “Can I…” Your first job is to get them out of this mind-set. Some people take well to explaining. Others take well to a step-on-up attitude with questions like “I don’t know, can you?” Whatever method you use, help them get out of that mind-set where they ask for permission.

### Tailor This to your Group

It should go without saying that you should tailor the language you use to what your players like and respond well to. It _should_ go without saying, but it needs to be said anyway.

If you’re running for people you’ve never met before, like at a convention, start off with whatever you feel is more neutral language until you gauge what they do and don’t like.

#### Going Beyond These Rules

This section just scratches the surface of interacting with the players. The more you do this, the more you’ll refine these ideas and bring in your own, creating a really cool toolbox for running epic games.

## Describe the World

A Mythic World will give you some touchstones for how to describe that world. When you start an adventure, and whenever the action moves to a new location, paint the world with your words. The players rely on you to give the world a sense of reality in their minds, and poor or sparse description will leave more questions in their minds than answers.

The list from **Exploring the Mythic World**, page 70 of the **Playing Adventures** chapter, has many questions to consider for every scene. Don’t try to answer every question every time, but think about some of them whenever you describe the world. And note down your own questions if you think of any! More tools for your Mythmaster toolbox.

The same approach can be taken to all other moments in the game.

### Playing to Perceptions

To Mythenders, the entire world is a place where hateful Myths roam and mortals live in fear. This doesn’t mean that’s the true world; gods can do some good and mortals don’t always live in fear. You can get a lot of mileage out of playing with the perceptions that Mythenders (and players) have about the Mythic World.

Imagine a game where you’re Ending, say, Santa Claus. Santa is known for going around have giving good children gifts and bad children coal. And on the whole, kids love Santa.

Now cast Santa as the God of Childhood Morality, with Mythenders gunning for him. Suddenly, the peaceful North Pole becomes the Mythic North (or the Mythic Pole), land where Santa and his host of elven serfs labor to craft toys for those children who are worthy in his harsh and judging eyes, with foul fates awaiting those who are not. It’s easy to get behind Ending this Myth, because that’s a vile take on Santa. And in Mythender, the ends tend to justify the means, so if there are misfit toys and elves in your path to get to Santa, then these fools are to be cut down.

Does that mean the Santa Claus isn’t the same Santa that you and I grew up hearing stories about? Not necessarily. What you describe and what the Mythenders experience is filtered through their perception. Likewise, Odin and his ilk have been kind and just to mortals in real mythology. Use that to your advantage.

### Use Backgrounds

As you’re describing new things about the world, look at the Mythenders. Do you have any apostates in the group? Introduce some fellows she ran out on. Do you have any mourners? Introduce mortals that he can connect with, or remind him or who he lost. A Mythender’s Past can be a treasure trove of ideas to make your adventure richer and make the Mythenders want to fight harder.

## Interact with the World

“Epic” is about the difference between the characters and the world around them. An epic character has no one above them and only their comrades and foes as peers.

### Mortals

Mortals know a Mythender on sight, and they fear them. While you might occasionally show a mortal as being brave and standing up to a Mythender, this should be rare (and not happen in the first adventure—so that when it happens, it’s noteworthy).

If you’re the sort of Mythmaster that stands up and is physically engaging, bow to the players as the mortals bow to the Mythenders. Don’t look them in the eye. Beg. Plead. Be resigned to your fate. Mortals know they may die in this moment, but some also hope that the Mythenders will take pity on them and better their lives. Act like that.

When the Mythenders are seeking sympathy and healing, play hard against them. They should be expressing their character’s emotional vulnerability to someone who sees them as alien or inhuman. Though you might dial it up or down, depending on how much of an emo moment the players want to explore, keep to this idea overall.

### Myths

Myths know a Mythender on sight, and know that there is only one course of action: battle. Many Myths will know they’re being sent to die, as Mythenders are powerful beings. Some Myths believe themselves able to be the one to End a Mythender. And the gods know that they will be reborn if they can cause a Mythender to fall and become a Myth.

Some Myths treat the Mythenders with respect, asking them to take their battle elsewhere and fight another god. Some Myths treat the Mythenders as peers, talking to them as they would a foe they are both excited by and afraid of. Grand gestures may be made, but all in all, no Myth dismisses Mythenders as mortals would ants.

If you _did_ play a Myth that dismisses a Mythender as being beneath them, the moment they strike in battle, you’d need to play out their surprise. Mythenders are the peers of gods in battle, and that needs to be reflected in their reactions.

Myths do not treat Mythenders the way they would treat mortals, so ensure that you do not when describing dialogue and reactions.

## Tone & Scale

One of your most important jobs in running <span class="mythender">Mythender</span>, and one of the hardest, is maintaining a sense of tone and scale with every action.

### Tone

There’s no set sense of the game’s tone—some will be dark, some will be campy, some will be high octane. Many will shift around, depending on what’s going on and what everyone wants (see **Metal & Drama**, page 4).

As the Mythmaster, you’re setting and checking tone constantly. Your introduction will set the tone—the language you use, the tone of your voice, physical gestures, etc. Consider these two descriptions for “I cut off Odin’s ear”:

“You’re all ‘I slice off his ear, right?’ Sweet! SLICE! Blood flows everyone. Odin’s screaming all over the place, causing earthquakes with his thrashing rage. You’re there like a badass, holding his fuckin’ ear in our hand. Hell yeah!”

“Your blade finds the corner where his ear meets his head, and bites into his flesh. He struggles to stop you, but you are too fast, your sword sundering his flesh, blood dripping down from his face. The ear falls into your hand, and Odin backs away, rage in his eyes as the blood on his face literally boils away.”

How you present descriptions in your game will color how the game feels. As long as it never stops feeling epic in a battle, any tone can work. But the trick is maintaining tone in your game, and only shifting tone when it feels right—whatever that ends up meaning for your group.

If you’re describing things with one sense of tone, and the players are all describing with another, that will be jarring. When this happens, talk about what sort of tone you all want as a group.

#### How to Talk about Tone

Unless you’re around a bunch of screenwriters or improv players, asking “What tone do we want?” will get met with vague answers. The problem with vague answers is that it might seem clear what you mean when you say “I want a light game,” but that could mean something else to the person hearing that. And without talking more, you don’t know that there’s a huge disconnect in what you all mean until a problem happens.

Ask more specific questions and use popular culture and media as touchstones. “Do we want this to be a dark game? Or more like a Jason Statham-if-he-fought-gods sort of thing?” “Are you more Batman or Superman?”

But don’t obsess over this. The point is to make a quick touchstone, not spend hours writing up a contract.

#### Shifting Tone

At times, the tone will (and should) shift a bit. If you’re playing in epic fifth-gear all the time, that will get tiring. As long as the tone shift feels natural—ideally, shifting in and out of battles rather than in the middle of one—then you’re managing tone well.

#### Checking Tone

If there’s a tone mismatch going on, particularly if you have a delicate tone like “Gothic horror Mythender” that can easily get squashed by being silly or over-the-top in the wrong way, take a moment and call people on that when that happens. Policing tone is part of your job, so make sure you do that. “Hey, I don’t think that’s in our tone. How else could you describe it?” Ending those comments in a question helps put the spotlight back on them to fix the situation.

If that happens often, maybe you’re the one with the tone mismatch. Take a moment to ask if there needs to be a change in the game.

### Scale

Scale is the other element you need to keep an eye out for. There are three sense of scale in the battle: Legendary, Mythic, and Titanic (see **Scales of Action**, page 125). While there are some guidelines for what fits in one scale or another, there are no hard lines or rules. Each group may want a different sense of scale.

You job is to keep the sense of scale _consistent_. When something gets described as a Mythic action, and everyone accepts that, then that can’t later be treated as a Legendary or Titanic action. If there’s no consistency, they you lose the sense of price and consequence of the game. And if you lose that, you lose much of the game’s feel.

Don’t worry about remembering every little detail; if you do your job here, you (and everyone) will internalize what feels like a Legendary, Mythic or Titanic action. When one of those feels off, then it’s your job to call the player on it and say things like “No, that’s not a Titanic action. Step it up or it’s just Mythic.” Do this without fear, and you will have a good sense of scale throughout the game.

Be explicit about scale in the first battle, while people are getting used to the rules. Talk about why something’s Legendary, Mythic, or Titanic. Help people grasp the difference between those three things.

Similarly, terrorizing mortals for power should always feel Mythic or Titanic. Call out when someone is claiming they’re terrorizing for power but not describing it strongly enough. And call out the converse, when a player is describing their Mythender doing something that should be covered under **Epic, Badass Feats** (page 176) or **Terrorizing for Power**(page 172). And when they attempt to gain sympathy, remember to kill the moment if the Mythender moves into a more Mythic tone or scale.

### This is Why It’s Your Job to Push Forward the Most

Setting tone and scale is why the Mythmaster does much of the Push Forward narration during battles and when Mythenders fail when seeking sympathy and healing. These are the lowest moments in the game, dramatically speaking. So when they get to Push Forward, they see what you’ve done and have a baseline for topping that.

## Pacing

If playing Mythender is like playing in a band, as the Mythmaster you’re the drummer. You’re the timekeeper. Your job is to push the game when it needs to be pushed and slow down when it needs to slow down.

### The Start an Adventure

Most <span class="mythender">Mythender</span> games should start with a little bit of description, and then jump right into a small battle. That sets the game up on a high note, with triumphant Mythenders then meeting mortals who watched them battle. This makes every adventure start off answering the question the players have in their minds: “Am I badass?” Yes. Yes, you are.

### Players & Desires

Battles are easy to maintain pacing; the structure takes care of it for you. It’s the Mythenders’ time that’s tricky, because that depends on what you and the players want out of the game. Some players will want to take time to explore what it means to be a Mythender around mortals, and others just want to stab Thor in the face over and over.

If you have players who want to explore the mortal side of the world, have situations when they have to deal with mortals. Sit back and let them direct you. Play the world in reaction to the Mythender’s words and actions. This is a great place to push players, if you have the sort of players that want to be pushed out of their comfort zones.

If you have players who just want to play out battles, the moments between battles serves as a palette cleanser and a time when they can be horrible beings to gain power or try to preserve their lives and mortal nature. In that case, it’s often enough to give them a quick moment where they can choose, or not, to do something with the mortals. Ask “so, you’re here, do you want to terrorize for power or seek sympathy and heal your soul?” Then jump into another battle when everyone’s had a moment.

If you have a mix between the two, err on the side of players who want to explore the mortal side, but also be willing to cut that short, interrupting a moment with the Myths bringing a new battle to them.

No matter how they like pacing, keep one thing in mind: when they want to be horrible people, give them free reign to do so. When they’re trying to maintain or regain their humanity, play hard against them. (This gets into interaction, page 240, but is also an element of pacing.)

### Let No Moment Drop

If the players are looking at you and waiting for you to speak, do one of two things: introduce a mortal situation or start a new battle.

#### Introduce a mortal situation and ask “What are you going to do?”

Have a mortal come up and ask the Mythenders for something. Or have the Mythenders come across mortals doing something that could involve them. Then ask “What do you do?” Make the situation feel like there’s a consequence to both action and inaction.

#### Start a New Battle

A lull in the moment could mean it’s time for Mythenders to go knife a Myth in the face. So bring on the Myths! The Mythenders’ time is over and it’s time for a new battle.

#### Take Breaks

Take short breaks now and then. Think of it like sex: take a breath and have a (metaphorical) cigarette before going at it again. While it’s fun to power through and keep on without stopping, mental stamina will fade. Especially look to taking breaks after a battle.

By actually getting up and disengaging from the game, you can reset a sense of pacing. Like any skill, this takes some time to get used to and skilled at, but once you have it down it’ll help you immensely.

## Drifting & Hacking Mythender

This game was built to be drifted to other settings and ideas! And even if it wasn’t, you people would do it anyway. That’s part of what makes this gaming community great and full of inspired works. Here are some things to think about when you’re drifting this game.

### The Core of Mythender

<span class="mythender">Mythender</span> is a game where the main characters have to deal with a conundrum: the protagonists have the ability and cause to do batshit-awesome stuff, and they need to be batshit-awesome to achieve their goals, but being too batshit-awesome will cause them to become Something Very Bad And Worse Than Dying.

So as long as you’re drifting this to a setting where that’s possible and part of it, you’re off to a good start. Like, say, a setting about warrior-monks with laser swords and telekinesis…

### Drifting Weapons

Weapons are the props and action points of the game. The three kinds of Weapons trigger three different sets of rules, but they’re easy to reskin. For a game with some more psychodrama, you could make Intrinsic Weapons explicitly about a memory they have, and charging it means describing flashbacks.

You may even want to mandate people have a certain sort of Weapon. In Mythic Japan, being set during the Meiji Restoration where Japanese Mythenders are Ending Oni and their influence on the Shogunate, Mythenders have a western Rifle as a Relic Weapon and an Intrinsic Weapon based on the first Oni they Ended.

### Drifting Scale

The three scales of action—Legendary, Mythic, and Titanic—are a great point to drift. Determining what in your game triggers using the Mythic die is important to knowing how to run your drift. Ideally, it’s alien or transgressive; normal people never get a Mythic die.

Further determining what it means to go from Mythic to Titanic is equally important. It could be a villainous act just as easily as an act of great power.

That’s not the only scale element that’s a hacking point. You could also change how long a turn is; it could be hours or days, rather than mere moments, to execute a different genre.

### Drifting Fates

In <span class="mythender">Mythender</span>, Fates are linked directly to the Myths the characters fight. But that needn’t be the case, as long as there is some dark Fate worse than dying that the characters are constantly flirting with.

There are classic themes in “become what you fight” and “become what you fear most.”

#### Forms

In some settings, having the characters dramatically change Form doesn’t make any sense. So that might be the first thing to cut or heavily change, as long as you keep the Corruption mechanics so that the Mythic die still works the same.

You might take inspiration from the old _Altered Beast_ video game: there the characters started beefy and got larger and more muscular, until the very end when they became a were-creature. Or the RPG _Exalted_, where as more power is taken, a sigil on the characters’ heads flare brighter and brighter. As long as there’s a telltale of the level of Corruption a protagonist has taken, you’re on the right track.

And they can easily all be the same or very similar changes, rather than something unique to each character.

#### Personal Blights

Personal Blights are important to playing in Norden, so that the players understand that a Mythender does literally change the world around him by just existing. If your setting is more about changing purely through action, that’s worth removing.

#### Fate’s Power

Similarly, the Fate’s Power is about a sense of niche-protection. Each Fate has a particular way of going batshit crazy while breaking the rules of reality. If your game is also about breaking reality, tailor to suit. If it isn’t, remove it; Weapons otherwise cover such action.

### Drifting Myths

Myths are the enemies of the characters, so they should be easy to drift. It’s just about changing the names and color around playing those foes.

### Drifting Mortals

How mortals interact with Mythenders is key to making the players feel like the truth about their characters. What truths are important in your game? Are they reviled and hated, like mutants in the Marvel universe? Are they believed to be a sign of the End Times? Whatever it is, don’t make it easy on the characters—they shouldn’t feel like they’re a part of society. In that regard, Mythender is much like the classic tale of the Western movie.

This can change how Seeking Sympathy works. Maybe instead of connecting with a stranger, you need to connect with someone you love or from your past that can’t comprehend who you are now.

### Changing the Names of Everything

It should go without saying that the names of all the pieces and rules should change to fit the drifted setting better. It could be easy to take the players out of the moment by telling them to roll the Mythic die when they’re psychic warrior-monks, but another to tell them to roll the Dark Side die. By changing the names, it’ll push people to play the way that setting requires.

Be sure to keep to your theme. The Mythic die is never a purely good thing, for instance.

### Adding New Rules

You’re of course welcome to add new rules, create new Gifts, things like that. There isn’t much guidance to give directly on that, but know that the door’s open.

I’ll say that not every rule I made for <span class="mythender">Mythender</span> is in this book. Some were removed not because they sucked, but because they didn’t fit the vision for this game as it took shape. There’s definitely room for, say, meta-mechanics that are affected based on what you do overall in an adventure and how it changes the whole world in a concrete way.

## Mythmaster Key Techniques

#### Police Tone

Keeping a consistent tone for a given stretch of time is crucial. Breaking tone intentionally should happen as a result of dealing with mortals and sympathy; otherwise, keep the consistency going to keep the game from becoming chaotic and gonzo.

#### Moderate Scale

Legendary, Mythic, and Titanic scales are important to a battle. Whatever you and the table decides is Legendary, Mythic, and Titanic, keep it consistent. Mythic and Titanic are about rewards and costs, and what one person does as Mythic should be Mythic to all.

#### Be their Narrative Butler

Keep presenting choices to the players. Address them with deference and humility when doing so. Make it feel like you’re handing opportunities of action or drama on a silver platter.

#### Describe the World

The Mythic World is a fantastic place. Use multiple points of description: sky, distance, terrain, water, weather, mortals, Myths, Blights, colors, sounds, etc.

#### Own up to & Fix Mistakes

You’ll make mistakes. Own up to them and fix them (when fixing is possible), and you’ll keep the table’s trust.

#### Treat Players as their Mythenders

Address the players by their characters’ names, or the title “Lord/Lady Mythender.” Bow and grovel to them at times. When playing mortals, treat the players like the could kill you, the Mythmaster, with a thought. When playing Myths, treat the players like they’re dangerous (and maybe foolish) equals.

#### Ask Questions

The players own the Mythic World as much as you do, and as much as you invite them to. Ask questions about what’s going on, about what her Mythender in thinking or why she’s doing something. When they ask about the world, sometimes turn the question around.

#### Let No Moment Drop

Nothing kills momentum like a moment where no one knows what to do next. Introduce new things. Start a new battle. The Mythic World doesn’t wait for Mythenders.

#### Challenge the Mythenders

Mythenders exist in a world that hates and fears them, from Myths that know the purpose of Mythenders to mortals who fear power they cannot comprehend. Make Seeking Sympathy the roughest thing a Mythender has to do. Survive battles as long as you can to push Corruption. Make the Mythenders earn their continued mortality.

#### Celebrate the Mythenders

The players are awesome people for playing in your game. Celebrate their characters achievements and their moments of Corruption. The Myths may want to see them die or Fall, but you want to see them do awesome and important things (and maybe die or Fall).

#### Take Breaks

When you need a moment to collect your thoughts, especially in between a transition between Mythmaster’s time and Mythenders’ time (or vice versa), take a break. This also helps break and reset tone, when the nature of the game shifts from high-octane to emo.

### Key Phrases

These sorts of phrases are great for eliciting certain emotional responses from your group. When I’m running <span class="mythender">Mythender</span>, these are my go-to tools for getting the players to feel appropriate to the moment, to challenge them, remind them of their Mythenders’ power, and to be humble to them. Tailor these as you see fit, and create some of your own.

#### “Yeah, you do!”

Celebrate their moments of high action, especially Mythic and Titanic actions. Show that you, as the Mythmaster, are on the player’s side—because, when it comes to you both wanting to see Mythenders being awesome, you _are_ on the same side.

#### “I don’t know, can you?”

Help players realize that they can declare a great deal of things. When they ask for something that <span class="mythender">Mythender</span> says they should just boldly declare, turn that around on them. (For those who hate this sort of treatment, **“You’re a Mythender, you don’t need to ask for that”** can also work.)

In other situations, this can also help create an esprit de corps.

#### “If I may suggest, Lord Mythender…”

This is part of being a narrative butler. When suggesting things, suggest from a place of deference and respect.

#### “My apologies, Lady Mythender.”

When you make a recommendation that the player doesn’t care for or make a mistake in the game, play at being of lower status than the players.

#### “Should I also change your diaper?”

When a player is showing a bit of weakness or indecision, and you think they could do better if prodded, push this. This is not just about that player, but as the rest of the group will hear it, it’s a reminder to them to step on up.

# Extended Rules

## Gaining Greater Weapons

### Greater Weapons

A normal Weapon is one with only one type: <span class="keyword">Intrinsic</span>, <span class="keyword">Relic</span>, or <span class="keyword">Companion</span> (described on page 129). A Greater Weapon has two of those types, granting that Weapon access to both rules. Because a Greater Weapon combines two types, its changes to reflect its dual nature. Most Greater Myths have such Weapons, hence the name <span class="keyword">Greater Weapons</span>.

<span class="keyword">Intrinsic/Relic</span>: a physical Weapon of great importance that’s bound into your soul and intertwined with your cunning or skill. It can appear and disappear at will, and cannot be taken from you via the <span class="keyword">Vicious Denial</span> Gift.

<span class="keyword">Intrinsic/Companion</span>: creatures or servants as Weapons that are bound into your core nature. You can summon or dispel them at will, and their number changes based on what you desire. This Weapon cannot be taken from you via the <span class="keyword">Vicious Denial</span> Gift.

<span class="keyword">Relic/Companion</span>: a physical Weapon of great importance that has fully intelligent and can sense the world around it as well as speak aloud. It has some small measure of will beyond normal Companions, but is still your servant and bids your will.

There are no Weapons that combine all three types.

### Gaining Greater Weapons

Mythenders start with three normal Weapons, and may transform their Weapons into Greater Weapons as they End gods and survive.

After Ending a Greater Myth at the climax of an adventure,if your Mythender has survived— neither dying or falling into Myth—you may change one of the Weapons on your playsheet into a Greater Weapon. This involves two things: describing how you change or replace one of your existing Weapons with some element or essence of the Myth you just Ended, and embracing sweet, permanent Corruption and Fate.

#### Changing the Weapon

When you describe changing your Weapon, you must include taking some element of the Myth you Ended, as only the Greater Myths and those who blatantly steal their power may command Greater Weapons. Once you have, rename the Weapon on your sheet and mark the two types it now has.

This can involve changing one of your Weapons (and thus adding a second type to that Weapon), it or can involve throwing one Weapon aside for something new (and picking any two types you wish).

**_Example: “I take Thor’s dominion over lighting into me and mix it with my <span class="keyword">Mastery over the Elements</span> Intrinsic Weapon, creating <span class="keyword">Dominion Over Mythic Nature</span>. This is now an Intrinsic/Companion Greater Weapon.”_**

**_Example: “I cast aside <span class="keyword">My Father’s Sword</span> and grab <span class="keyword">Mjölnir</span>, taking it as a Relic/Companion Greater Weapon, for the horror voice of the dead Thor speaks from it.”_**

**_Example: “With <span class="keyword">My Mother’s Sickle</span> in my left hand, I take Mjölnir in my right. Together, they fuse into me something deeper, my <span class="keyword">Hammer and Sickle that will Birth Freedom</span> Intrinsic/Relic Greater Weapon.”_**

Once you have done this, the Weapon is now a permanent element of your Mythender. You can never charge or remove it. Only in death might it go away from the world.

#### Embracing Permanent Corruption & Fate

Once you take a new Greater Weapon, you must pay the price for imbuing yourself with a god’s nature. But hey, it’s no big deal! All you do is gain permanent Corruption and Fate! Increase the amount of permanent Corruption and permanent Fate you have by 1. See **Permanent Corruption & Fate**, page 197, for how to mark this.

### Credit Where It’s Due

These rules started out as an idea from Christopher Lavery, after noticing that Greater Myths had Weapons with two types, which sparked conversation that lead to these rules. You have him to thank for this extra layer of temptation.

## Mythender Moments & Mythic Wrath

Mythender Moments are part of what make the game work—they’re the opportunities the Mythenders have to show if they’re still mortal enough to care about and understand how the mortals around them are, or to show if they’re falling to the siren song of Mythic Power. But sometimes that can lead to Mythenders wanting to spend a long time dealing with mortals or terrorizing them, and the Mythic World waits for no Mythender.

Instead of just letting the Mythenders have one moment each, their time can take as long as they want with this extended rule. However, the more time they take, the longer the Mythic World has to prepare the next challenge for them, and may even become impatient and lash out at the Mythenders and the mortals around them.

### Moments & Accumulating Wrath Points

After each Mythender Moment, the Mythmaster will roll a single die in secret, and use that to tell you what the Mythic World is doing during this time. This is represented by <span class="keyword">Wrath points</span>, accumulating until either the Mythenders progress to their next challenge or that next challenge appears, ready to battle. The Wrath points are kept in secret, as the Mythenders are not wholly omniscient regarding the Mythic World’s machinations.

When the Mythenders’ being playing out their Moments, the Mythmaster has 0 Wrath points. After every Mythender Moment, roll a die. The number on that die adds to your Wrath points. There are a couple factors that will alter the result of the die:

- For the first Moment in a turn, subtract 3 from the result. Likewise, for the second Moment in a turn, subtract 2 from the result.
- If you think the Moment is particularly long, add 1 to the result.

If the result is zero or less, no Wrath points are gained from that Moment.

### The Myth Attacks!

If the Wrath points reach the <span class="keyword">Wrath threshold</span> (10 for three or fewer Mythenders, 13 for four), then the Mythic World has grown impatient and assaults the Mythenders. The Mythmaster will describe the next Mythic challenge appearing before or charging at the Mythenders, as well as carnage and calamity that the Myth causes. Then launch immediately into battle.

This Myth comes prepared for war: it starts with 2 more Might tokens and a number of additional Thunder dice equal to the total Wrath points minus 5. In lieu of the Might tokens, it may immediately create a Blight as part of narrating the carnage and calamity, which is usable on its first turn in battle.

### When the Mythenders Proceed

If the Mythenders process to the next challenge before the Wrath points have hit the Wrath threshold, the Myth still had some time to embolden itself. If the Mythmaster has 5 Wrath points (regardless of number of players), the Myth gains 1 additional Might token. It also gains an additional amount of Thunder dice equal to the Wrath points minus 5.

## Chaining Actions in Battles

On each round in battle, after the first Mythender has had an action, the other Mythenders may <span class="keyword">Chain Actions</span>. When Describing Being Awesome, if your Mythender’s action incorporates what the Mythender immediately before you just did, then you gain 1 bonus Storm die on this roll.

This is only available if the person who went before you is a Mythender. The first Mythender to go on a round cannot use this, because the Myth just went. Likewise, if the Myth uses the <span class="keyword">Swiftness</span> Gift, the following Mythender cannot use this option. And because you roll no Storm dice on a Titanic action, this option doesn’t do you any good then.

If you choose to use this option, the Mythmaster might add 1 to each Greater Myth’s Storm rating, to keep it interesting. Or not. The Mythic World is capricious.

_Note_: This rule is a small one that rewards players who pay attention and celebrate each other’s actions in battle, but it’s also one more thing to keep track of when gathering dice.

In addition, the following Gift involves Chaining Actions:

### Barbed Chains

<span class="gift-qualifier">Mythenders only</span>

When you Chain off another Mythender’s action, gain 2 bonus Storm dice instead of 1. A Mythender who Chain off your action also gain this benefit (which does not stack if she also has this Gift).

In addition, the Might cost to use the <span class="keyword">Swiftness</span> Gift immediately after your action increases by 4.

## Culling Reality

Ending gods is not enough for some Mythenders. Among those godslayers, there’s a philosophy: the Mythic World is merely a symptom of a greater problem—that existence itself is flawed and needs to be reforged. That concepts themselves must be _culled_ if there is hope for a truly better Mortal World once all Myths are Ended.

Every Mythender has a different idea of what must be culled: grief, hunger, lust, sickness, fear, hope, the tyranny of kings, war, death, written language, and so on. Even the vaguest of notions, like the color yellow, may be destroyed.

And every Mythender has within herself the very power to unmake elements of creation. This is what we call Culling. And once something is Culled, all mortalkind forgets it had ever existed. Written records involving it are unmade. It can never again exist, and only the Mythenders who were there at the time of this Culling have memories of a time where this concept was alive in the world.

### When You Can Cull

The moment you End a Greater Myth at the end of an adventure, provided you are neither dead nor fallen into Myth, you may attempt to Cull a concept. You each can only Cull one concept at this time, but the concept can be dangerously broad.

### What You Can Cull

Anything that is a concept mortals understand or experience may be Culled. It can be something broadly philosophical or social (war, language, treachery, marriage), emotional (fear, hope, lust, rage), biological (hunger, death), or of the natural world (colors, gravity, wind, wolves, snow). If there’s a god that represents such a concept, that concept is fair game.

You cannot Cull concepts that are Mythic. That means not saying “I Cull Loki” or “I Cull the entire Mythic World.” (Though, see page 260…) What you Cull has no effect on the nature of Mythic beings. Nor can you Cull the “absence” of something mortals aren’t experiencing. Finally, you cannot Cull any of <span class="mythender">Mythender</span>’s rules, including Culling itself.

### How to Cull

First, the surviving Mythenders decide on what they wish to Cull, if anything. Then they roll dice to see if this time, the Cull succeeds. If anything is Culled, the Mythmaster describes the consequences in the world, whether immediate or what’s destined to happen in the future.

#### Deciding on What to Cull

Decide on what you’re going to attempt to Cull, if anything, as per above. The Mythmaster has the right to veto any ideas that don’t mesh with these rules, in which case talk it out and come to some other concept (or successfully justify your concept). Word your concept carefully, for it’s the letter, not the spirit, that matters.

If two or more Mythenders choose the exact same concept, word for word, they may poll their resources in the next part.

Mythenders always know what each other are about to attempt to Cull. This means that they might disagree! If you object to what another Mythender wishes to Cull, you have three options: do nothing and hope he won’t succeed, civilly talk it over and convince him to choose something else, or Murder him (which takes place before the following step).

#### Rolling to Cull

Each Mythender attempting to Cull gathers dice based on which of the following apply:

- 1 die if you were the one whose action Ended the Greater Myth.
- 1 die if you possess 20 or more Lightning tokens at the end of the battle (counting 2 Thunder dice for 1 Lightning); the Lightning spent to End this Myth doesn’t count.
- 1 die for every god you’ve Ended, including this one. (Only those Ended in play count, none that are part of a Mythender’s backstory.)
- 1 die for every time you’ve attempted to Cull this exact concept in the past and failed.

Then roll the dice. Discard any that don’t come up a ![6](/catalog/creators/ryan-macklin/mythender/storm-6.svg). None of your Gifts allow you to modify this roll. For those attempting to Cull the same concept, now poll your dice together.

If the concept is directly related to the god you just Ended, then it’s Culled if you have at least two ![6](/catalog/creators/ryan-macklin/mythender/storm-6.svg)s. If the concept is not directly related, then it’s Culled if you have at least four ![6](/catalog/creators/ryan-macklin/mythender/storm-6.svg)s.

#### The Consequences of Culling

Once a concept has been Culled, it no longer exists and mortals neither remember it nor can conceive of it existing. The Mythmaster then describes any immediate effects that has on this scene, and the lasting effects it will have in the world—which the Mythenders instantly know of the moment the Cull happens. (_Hint_: expect the Mythmaster to interpret the loss of this concept as literally and as viciously as possible. That’s where the fun lies.)

That said, time itself isn’t undone; previous effects from the Culled concept existing in the world still happened. Unless you Cull time itself, I guess. Good luck figuring that one out.

### Example: Beatrice Culls Lust

Beatrice’s backstory parallels Jeanne d’Arc, and she sees lust as the root of so many of the world’s evils. She seeks not to End gods because the gods are inherently wrong, but because in Ending them, she has the power to Cull lust.

As she Ends Freyja, she has her moment to “fix the world.” Her action Ended the god, she doesn’t have much Thunder or Lightning left, she’s Ended a god before this one (meaning she’s Ended two), and she failed to Cull lust last time. That means she has 4 dice to roll.

She rolls ![6,](/catalog/creators/ryan-macklin/mythender/storm-6.svg) ![2,](/catalog/creators/ryan-macklin/mythender/storm-2.svg) ![6,](/catalog/creators/ryan-macklin/mythender/storm-6.svg) ![and 5](/catalog/creators/ryan-macklin/mythender/storm-5.svg), succeeding in Culling lust! The Mythmaster then describes how in a generation, the human race will dwindle into extinction. But hey, no more lust in their hearts!

### The History of this Rule

This rule existed, though in an ad hoc format, in my home campaign back in 2008. In that game, one of the Mythenders ended the concept of lust. That Mythenders could do that was part of character creation then, where you would write down the concept you most hated in the world.

The problem was that once I started playing this mostly at conventions, it was confusing. It made character creation take a bit longer, because it was so high-concept. Some people couldn’t wrap their heads around the idea. And it added a few awkward minutes to the end of a strong climatic moment. So I removed it.

For those who get it and can rock it, I salute you. Go forth and make a fucked-up reality.

## Ending the Mythic World

<span class="mythender">Mythender</span> is about adventures against individual gods with a Mythic World. It’s an episodic game, meant to be played not as a long campaign but as something fun to do here and there. So the Mythic World is implied to be full of gods and Greater Myths that are just waiting to be Ended next time you play.

Yet, the premise is that Mythenders want to End all the Myths. So, fuck it, let’s take this sucker off the chain and get really crazy. The rule is simple: _when you End Mythic World’s last god, and none of the Mythenders Fall in that battle, the Mythic World itself is forever Ended._

There’s a catch: when a Mythender Falls, that creates a new god for the Mythic World... which is exactly what the Mythic World wants. At a certain point, the Mythic World wins, and curses the Mythic Hearts within the surviving Mythenders, lest they risk bringing the Mythic World to is doom.

### Mythic Norden

Mythic Norden has the six Greater Myths detailed in that chapter: Thor, Odin, Freyja, Loki, Jörmungandr, and Fenrir. End them all, and Mythic Norden itself is Ended.

Should Norden ever have 12 gods, it wins. For all eternity. (Technically, if you look at all or Norse Myth, there are many gods. For the purposes of this rule, just consider six “main” gods, and the rest as less important Greater Myths—if you even bother to feature them in the campaign)

Naturally, you can play with those gods and numbers.

### Ending the Mythender Curse

Does the curse of being a Mythender—of being fated to die in battle or Fall into Myth—still hold once there’s no longer a Mythic World? Do the Mythenders become mortal again, or are they damned to live out immortality, and always at risk of Falling and birthing a whole new Mythic World?

That’s a damn good question. No one yet knows the answer.

### Other Mythic Worlds?

You could decide that the Mythic World that you’re playing in is the only Mythic World. Alternatively, you could have your Mythenders go to another place in reality when a different Mythic World holds sway.

(And yes, that totally means you can describe creating a character that came from another Mythic World, Ended it, and continues on.)

# Thanks & Acknowledgements

## Thanks & Blame

I blame Leonard Balsera.

Back in Autumn of 2007, when I was struggling on another design long since abandoned, Lenny said to me, “Dude, take a break and make a game about killing orcs or something.”

“Eh, if I’m going to do that I’d rather start big, like killing dragons,” I replied.

“Whatever, just go cleanse your palette and get back to your other game.”

That conversation led to this, my most ambitious idea to date, and I have Lenny to blame for that. Oh, and I never did get back to that other game. Turns out Paul Tevis did a better version of that game with _A Penny For My Thoughts_, on which I would later work with him.

Finally, a massive thank-you to my editor, Josh Roby. He pointed out a host of bullshit in the Random Kindness Encounter edition of the book, including organization and numerous language issues. You should hire the fuck out of him. He’s brilliant. (**joshroby.com**)

### Debts Owed

Every movie that has had a grand battle scene influenced <span class="mythender">Mythender</span>. Chief among them: _300_, _Beowulf_, _Final Fantasy VII: Advent Children_, _The Two Towers_, and _Return of the King_.

This game also owes a debt to the big set-piece role-playing games, namely _Dungeons & Dragons_. And this game’s high concept wouldn’t have happened without _Nobilis_ by Jenna Moran. Mythenders are a twist on _Nobilis_’ Excrucians, making them the center of the story.

Some other games that were influential: John Harper’s _Agon_, Christian Griffen’s _Beast Hunters_, Fred Hicks’s _Don’t Rest Your Head_, and White Wolf’s _Exalted_. I’m certain there are many that subtly influenced me over the years that I’m not listing here, so I hope you’ll indulge a blanket thank-you to the various RPG creative communities out there.

I believe it was Josh Hoade who gave me the tagline “Kick Ass, Erase Names.” That was a focus, a catalyst, for the tone I’ve taken this text and game.

My home playtest squad—Aaron, Jerry, and Mike—built a story with this game that still surprises me. This game would be an empty shell if not for that campaign.

Finally, I personally owe a great debt to all my great playtesters and people who have let me bounce ideas off of them or gave me feedback over the years. And I owe a debt to my comrades in the Evil Hat family for forging me into the game designer and developer I am today. This is not a game I could have made when I started; I only can now because of you all.

Thank you,

—Ryan Macklin

### A Few Memories

I won’t go into many—I can’t, for I haven’t the space—but there are some special moments in playtesting that I want to give personal thanks to:

- **Joe:** I will not forget that angelic fiddle, nor will I forget the line “My action is that I die and am reborn. That hurts the Myth, right?” (For the record, that still does.)
- **Jerry:** what you do to horses is insane.
- **Shawn:** you showed me how awesome dynastic character creation can be.
- **David:** the moment where you held the mortal and apologized for existing still moves me today.
- **Andrew:** you got away with it once. Don’t push your luck.
- **Brendan:** you’re the reason the Child is a playable option.
- **Lillian & Nora:** you two made Murder totally rad.
